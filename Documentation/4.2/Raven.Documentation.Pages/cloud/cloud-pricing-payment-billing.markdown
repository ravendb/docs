# RavenDB on the Cloud: Pricing, Payment and Billing

{NOTE: }

You can run a product and pay for it using a credit card or a wire transfer, per-minute without committing to anything 
or with a yearly agreement, gaining a substantial discount.

{PANEL: Pricing}

You can pay for your instances by one of three models:  

* **On-Demand Payment**  
* **Yearly with _no_ Upfront payment**  
* **Yearly _with_ an Upfront payment**  

---

####On-Demand Payment  

The on-demand model lets you pay for your instance **by the minute**, and come and go as you please.  
We will measure your instance run-time **from rising to termination**, and charge you with **minute granularity**.  

You may find this model useful if you look for flexibility.  You are not tied to a particular configuration 
and are free to shift between configurations at will. 

{NOTE: }
We charge on-demand **by the minute**, with a **minimum limit of one hour**.  
If you run an instance for 93 minutes, you will pay for exactly 93 minutes.  
If you run it for less than an hour, say 42 minutes, you will still be charged for a full hour worth to match the minimum limit.  
{NOTE/}

---

####Yearly Payment  

We offer two models of yearly payments: **Yearly with no upfront payment**, and **Yearly with an upfront payment**.  
Both grant you discounts in relation to the on-demand model.  

**Be aware** however that once a yearly contract has been activated, it is charged fully to the end of the contract 
and cannot be revoked, halted or changed.  

{NOTE: }

* Terminating a product you've been paying for yearly, will **not** stop your monthly payments.  
  
* Upscaling or downscaling a product you're paying for yearly, will **not** revoke the yearly agreement.  
  Expenses for the new product will be calculated according to its on-demand fee and charged-for separately.  

* **Adding nodes to an existing cluster** with a yearly contract, however, does **not** incur additional expenses 
  beyond the cost of running the new nodes.  

{NOTE/}

####Yearly with NO upfront payment  
Committing for a year and **paying monthly**, grants you a **5% discount**.  
![Yearly No Upfront](images/pricing-003-payment-models-yearly-no-upfront.png "Yearly No Upfront")

---

####Yearly WITH an upfront payment  
Committing for a year and **paying for it all in advance**, grants you a **10% discount**.  
![Yearly Upfront](images/pricing-004-payment-models-yearly-upfront.png "Yearly Upfront")

{NOTE: }
Yearly contracts are relevant only for [production products](../cloud/cloud-instances#a-production-cloud-cluster).  
[Development products](../cloud/cloud-instances#a-development-cloud-server) can only use the on-demand model.  
{NOTE/}

---

####Viewing current configuration price  
While [provisioning or editing](../cloud/portal/cloud-portal-products-tab) your product, 
costs are shown in the **Your Order** slot.  

The overall price is an outcome of your hardware configuration and pricing model, 
with possible [additional expenses](../cloud/cloud-pricing-payment-billing#additional-expenses).  

See for example the price differences between the production basic-grade configurations PB10 and PB20:  

* Production Basic 10:  
  ![PB10](images/pricing-001-PB10.png "PB10")  

* Production Basic 20:  
  ![PB30](images/pricing-001-PB30.png "PB30")  
  
You will also be able to find your products' costs in the [billing tab](../cloud/portal/cloud-portal-billing-tab).  

---

####Additional Expenses

Your pricing model does **not** cover incidental expenses over -  

* **Data Transfer**  
  Charges over traffic to and from your instances will be added to your basic pricing plan.  

* **Expanding your Disk Storage**  
  When the disk space allocated for your product is 90% full, we will expand it to avoid running out of storage.  
  Your payment plan will be updated to reflect the new storage size.  
    {NOTE: }
     Deleting files to reduce storage usage after the storage has been expanded will **not** revoke the expansion.  
    {NOTE/}

* **Backup Storage**  
  Your RavenDB Cloud runs automatic backups on a regular schedule.  
  Depending on your retention settings, you may be charged for highly available storage of your backups.  
    {NOTE: }
     Your plan includes a 1GB / month backup storage. 
    {NOTE/}

{PANEL: Payment}

You can currently pay by credit card or wire transfer.  

---

####Credit Card  
You can provide your credit card details while creating your account, or skip this stage and return to it later.  
To provide your credit card details at any time, enter your [Account tab](../cloud/portal/cloud-portal-account-tab) 
and click the Add Credit Card button.  
Select your main credit card using the **Active** button, so we know which card to try first.  
If charging your active card fails, we'll try to charge other cards you may have provided.

{PANEL: Billing}

Your Portal's [Billing tab](../cloud/portal/cloud-portal-billing-tab) summarizes your 
outstanding charges and past invoices. Additional data you can see there includes Daily cost, Total 
cost, and the expected charge at the end of this month.  

---

####Charging failures  
If we fail to charge your account using the payment method you provided, we'll notify 
you and retry for 7 days. Failure to pay after that period may result in account closure.
