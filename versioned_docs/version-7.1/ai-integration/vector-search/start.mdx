### Search by meaning and context using vector search

* Vector search enables you to retrieve content based on **semantic similarity** rather than exact keyword matches.  
  Instead of comparing text directly, RavenDB compares [Embeddings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedding_(machine_learning)),
  which are numeric vectors that represent meaning and context, allowing you to:  
  * Find text by meaning rather than wording
  * Retrieve related content even when exact terms do not appear
  * Match images by visual similarity 

* Vector search can be done using:  
  [Dynamic queries](../../ai-integration/vector-search/vector-search-using-dynamic-query) - suitable for ad-hoc or infrequent searches.  
  [Querying static-indexes that index vector fields](../../ai-integration/vector-search/vector-search-using-static-index) - suitable for optimized and repeated searches.  
    
* The embeddings used for vector search can be created in several ways:  
  on the fly, via background tasks, or from external sources.  
  Learn more in the [Vector search - Overview](../../ai-integration/vector-search/vector-search-overview.mdx) section.
  
* Vector search queries also empower other AI features in RavenDB such as [GenAI](../../ai-integration/gen-ai-integration/gen-ai_start) and [AI Agents](../../ai-integration/ai-agents/ai-agents_start).   
  These features can use vector search to retrieve relevant documents in response to LLM requests.

### Use cases

Vector search is suitable whenever you need to find similar items based on meaning or proximity, rather than exact matches.  
Common scenarios include:

* **Knowledge and document search**  
  Find relevant documentation, policies, legal texts, or enterprise reports using natural language queries.
* **Product and content recommendations**  
  Suggest similar products, articles, videos, or media based on descriptive queries and user preferences.
* **Customer support automation**  
  Route questions to the best help articles, retrieve guides, and power chatbot responses with relevant information.
* **Business intelligence and analysis**  
  Profile customers and uncover market trends by comparing behavioral and relationship-based similarities.
* **Media and content analysis**  
  Discover similar images, moderate content, and monitor social media for brand mentions and sentiment.
