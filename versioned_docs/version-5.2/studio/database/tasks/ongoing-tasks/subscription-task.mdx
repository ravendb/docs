# Subscription Task
<Admonition type="note" title="">

* Data subscriptions are task that automatically send certain documents to a subscribed 
client, called the "subscription worker".  

* This page explains how to create a subscription on the server side using the Studio.  

* In this page:
  * [Subscription Task Definition](../../../../studio/database/tasks/ongoing-tasks/subscription-task.mdx#subscription-task-definition)
  * [Testing Subscriptions](../../../../studio/database/tasks/ongoing-tasks/subscription-task.mdx#testing)
  * [Details in Task List View](../../../../studio/database/tasks/ongoing-tasks/subscription-task.mdx#details-in-task-list-view)

## Subscription Task Definition

![Figure 1. Subscription Task Definition](./assets/subscriptions-1.png)

1. The RQL query which selects which documents the subscription sends 
   to the client.  

2. Limit the age of the documents that will be retrieved. Default: "the 
   beginning of time" - meaning all documents are retrieved regardless of 
   age. The other options are:  
   * Latest document - of the documents that existed before the subscription 
     task began, retrieve only the newest one.  
   * Change vector - specify a starting point for the subscription by a 
     document change vector.  

3. Choose which node will perform this task by default.  

4. Test the subscription query.  



## Testing

![Figure 2. Testing Subscription](./assets/subscriptions-2.png)

Testing the subscription shows which documents are retrieved by the 
specified query.  

1. Limit the number of results to retrieve for this test.  

2. Limit how long - in seconds - the test should continue before 
stopping automatically.  

3. Run the test.
