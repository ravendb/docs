The concept of events provides users with a mechanism to perform custom actions in response to operations taken in a session. 

The event is invoked when a particular action is executed on an entity or querying is performed.

<Admonition type="info" title="Subscribing to an event" id="subscribing-to-an-event" href="#subscribing-to-an-event">
Subscribing an event can be done in the `DocumentStore` object, which will be valid for all future sessions or subscribing in an already opened session with `session.Advanced` which will overwrite the existing event for the current session. 
</Admonition>

## OnBeforeStore

This event is invoked as a part of `SaveChanges` but before it is actually sent to the server.

It takes the argument `BeforeStoreEventArgs` that consists of the `Session` entity's ID and the entity itself.

### Example

Say we want to discontinue all of the products that are not in stock. 

<TabItem value="on_before_store_event" label="on_before_store_event">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`private void OnBeforeStoreEvent(object sender, BeforeStoreEventArgs args)
\{
    var product = args.Entity as Product;
    if (product?.UnitsInStock == 0)
    \{
        product.Discontinued = true;
    \}
\}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

After we subscribe to the event, every stored entity will invoke the method.

<TabItem value="store_session" label="store_session">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`// Subscribe to the event
session.Advanced.OnBeforeStore += OnBeforeStoreEvent;

session.Store(new Product
\{
    Name = "RavenDB v3.5",
    UnitsInStock = 0
\});
session.Store(new Product
\{
    Name = "RavenDB v4.0",
    UnitsInStock = 1000
\});

session.SaveChanges(); // Here the method is invoked
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>



## OnBeforeDelete

This event is invoked as a part of `SaveChanges`, but before it actually sends the deleted entities to the server.

It takes the argument `BeforeDeleteEventArgs`, that consists of the `Session` entity's ID and the entity itself.

### Example

To prevent anyone from deleting entities we can create a method as follows:

<TabItem value="on_before_delete_event" label="on_before_delete_event">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`private void OnBeforeDeleteEvent(object sender, BeforeDeleteEventArgs args)
\{
    throw new NotSupportedException();
\}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

and subscribe it to the session:

<TabItem value="delete_session" label="delete_session">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`// Subscribe to the event
session.Advanced.OnBeforeDelete += OnBeforeDeleteEvent;

var product = session.Load<Product>("products/1-A");
var product2 = session.Load<Product>("products/2-A");

// OnBeforeDelete is triggered whether you
// call Delete() on an entity or on its ID
session.Delete(product);
session.SaveChanges(); // NotSupportedException will be thrown

session.Delete("products/2-A");
session.SaveChanges(); // NotSupportedException will be thrown
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>



## OnAfterSaveChanges

This event is invoked after the `SaveChanges` is returned. It takes the argument `AfterSaveChangesEventArgs` that consists of the `Session` entity's ID and the entity itself with the updated metadata from the server.

### Example

If we want to log each entity that was saved, we can create a method as follows:

<TabItem value="on_after_save_changes_event" label="on_after_save_changes_event">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`private void OnAfterSaveChangesEvent(object sender, AfterSaveChangesEventArgs args)
\{
    if (Log.IsInfoEnabled)
        Log.Info($"Document '\{args.DocumentId\}' was saved.");
\}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>



## OnBeforeQuery

This event is invoked just before the query is sent to the server.

It takes the argument `BeforeQueryEventArgs`, that consists of the `Session` and the `IDocumentQueryCustomization`.

### Example I

If you want to disable caching of all query results, you can implement the method as follows:

<TabItem value="on_before_query_execute_event" label="on_before_query_execute_event">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`private void OnBeforeQueryEvent(object sender, BeforeQueryEventArgs args)
\{
    args.QueryCustomization.NoCaching();
\}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

### Example II

If you want each query to [wait for non-stale results](../../../../indexes/stale-indexes.mdx) you can create an event as follows:

<TabItem value="on_before_query_execute_event_2" label="on_before_query_execute_event_2">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`private void OnBeforeQueryEvent(object sender, BeforeQueryEventArgs args)
\{
    args.QueryCustomization.WaitForNonStaleResults(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(30));
\}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
