# Authentication: Let's Encrypt Certificates

RavenDB 4.x uses X.509 certificates for authentication and authorization and has **built in support** for [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/).

## Obtain a Let's Encrypt Certificate

The [Setup Wizard Walkthrough](../../../start/installation/setup-wizard.mdx) explains how to obtain a free Let's Encrypt certificate for your server or cluster.

The certificate contains all of the domain names of the cluster in the ASN (Alternative Subject Name) property. For example, if you setup a 3 node cluster and choose the domain "example.ravendb.community", the certificate will contain 3 ASN entries:  

- a.example.ravendb.community  
- b.example.ravendb.community  
- c.example.ravendb.community  

This way, the same certificate is used in all the nodes of the cluster.

Let's Encrypt [recently announced](https://letsencrypt.org/2017/07/06/wildcard-certificates-coming-jan-2018.html) support for wildcard certificates, and RavenDB will start using them soon.

## Automatic Renewal

Let's Encrypt certificates have a [90-day lifetime policy](https://letsencrypt.org/2015/11/09/why-90-days.html).

In RavenDB, you don't need to worry about renewals. RavenDB takes care of this for you.

When there are 30 days left until expiration, RavenDB will initiate the certificate renewal and replacement process. The actual request to Let's Encrypt will happen on the nearest coming Saturday.

Once the renewed certificate is obtained, [it will be replaced](../../../server/security/authentication/certificate-renewal-and-rotation.mdx) in all the nodes of the cluster without needing to shut down any server.

<Admonition type="warning" title="Warning" id="warning" href="#warning"> 
Automatic renewals of certificates is available only if you obtained your certificate using the Setup Wizard and got your free RavenDB domain. It doesn't work for self-obtained certificates, even if issued by Let's Encrypt.
</Admonition>

When running as a cluster, the replacement process is a distributed operation. It involves sending the new certificate to all nodes, and requires all nodes to confirm receipt and replacement of the certificate.

Only when all nodes have confirmed, the cluster will start using this new certificate. 

If a node is not responding during the replacement, the operation will not complete until one of the following happens:

* The node will come back online. It should pick up the replacement command and join the replacement process automatically.

* There are only 3 days left for the expiration of the certificate. In this case, the cluster will complete the operation without the node which is down. When bringing that node up, the certificate must be replaced manually.

During the process you will receive alerts in the studio and in the logs indicating the status of the operation and any errors if they occur. The alerts are displayed for each node independently.

## Manual Renewal

You may initiate the renewal process manually by going to the certificate view in the studio and clicking `Renew` on the server certificate. It will trigger the same certificate replacement process which was described in `Automatic Renewal`.

If a node is down and you click `Renew`, the cluster will complete the operation without the node which is down. When bringing that node up, the certificate must be replaced manually.

## Updating DNS records

Updating DNS records for your domain can be acheived by running the Setup Wizard again or by using a dedicated page at the RavenDB website.

The [Customers Portal](https://customers.ravendb.net) allows to easily edit DNS records which are associated with your license.
