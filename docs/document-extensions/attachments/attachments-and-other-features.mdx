* Once an attachment is added to a document, the `@attachments` property is added to the document’s metadata with details about the attachment.
    
* This metadata update triggers any features that respond to document changes - 
  such as [Indexing](../../studio/database/indexes/indexes-overviewstudio/database/indexes/indexes-overview),
  any defined [ongoing tasks](../../studio/database/tasks/ongoing-tasks/general-info),
  [Subscriptions](../../client-api/data-subscriptions/what-are-data-subscriptions), etc.

<Panel heading="Attachments & Replication">
    
Replication is triggered by document changes, including when attachments are added or modified.  
**Internal replication** occurs automatically between noded in the database group.    
**External replication** is defined as an ongoing task between two RavenDB databases (typically across clusters).  
Learn more about replication in [Replication overview](../../server/clustering/replication/replication-overview).

For both internal and external replication:
 
**Local attachments**:  
The document is replicated along with the attachment's binary content, which will be stored on the target node.

**Remote attachments**:  
The document is replicated without the binary content, only the metadata is transferred.  
The attachment's content resides in shared remote storage (e.g., S3, Azure Blob) and does not need to be copied between nodes.

**Target server compatibility**:  
If the target node is running a RavenDB server version earlier than `7.2`, which does not support remote attachments,  
replicating a document that references a remote attachment will throw a `LegacyReplicationViolationException`.

**Remote destination configuration for external replication**:  
When using external replication, the remote storage destinations must also be configured on the target database.
This is your responsibility, RavenDB does not automatically replicate the remote attachment configurations.
If the destination is not defined on the target, the remote attachment will be inaccessible after replication.

<Panel heading="Attachments & RavenDB ETL">  

[RavenDB ETL task](../../server/ongoing-tasks/etl/raven) (which sends documents to another RavenDB database while you can transfrom documets via scritp...) 
is triggered by document changes, including when attachments are added or modified.
    
**Local attachments**:  
The document is sent to the target database along with the binary attachment stream.

**Remote attachments**:  
The document is sent without the binary stream, only the metadata is transferred, since the attachment content resides in remote storage.

**Remote destination configuration**:  
When documents that reference remote attachments are sent via RavenDB ETL, you must ensure that the same remote attachment configuration is defined on the target database.
This is your responsibility, as the ETL process does not automatically configure remote destinations on the target side.
  
**Target server compatibility**:    
If the target node is running a RavenDB server version earlier than `7.2`, which does not support remote attachments, 
attempting to send a document that references a remote attachment will result in an excetion.

<Panel heading="Attachments & export/import/backup/restore">
    
The following behavior applies to Export, Import, Backup, and Restore operations:
    
**Local attachments**:  
The binary content is included in the operation:  
During export/backup, the binary stream is written to the dump file.  
During import/restore, the binary stream is loaded from the dump into the database.  

**Remote attachments**:
Only metadata is included in the operation:  
During export/backup, only the metadata is written to the dump, the binary content remains in remote storage.
During import/restore, the metadata is loaded into the database, the content is expected to remain accessible in its original remote location.

**Remote destination configuration**:  
For import & restore:  
If remote attachments are included, the same remote storage destinations must be configured in the target database.  
This is your responsibility, RavenDB does not automatically transfer remote destination configurations as part of these operations.

<Panel heading="Attachments & Revisions">

local: supported
remote: not supported   
    

If [document revisions](../../document-extensions/revisions/overview) are enabled, any addition or removal of attachments will create a new revision of the document.
This is because the attachment metadata is part of the document and is updated when attachments change.

Any modification to the metadata of a document creates a revision when revisions are enabled.

## Remote Attachments (Optional Feature)

When Remote Attachments are enabled, RavenDB can upload attachments to external storage services such as:
Amazon S3
Azure Blob Storage

Instead of storing the binary stream directly in the database, the server stores a reference to the external location and uploads the content asynchronously in the background.

How it works:

Attachments are marked for remote upload at the time they are added
You configure remote destinations in the database settings
Uploads are handled by a background task, without blocking client operations

Remote Attachments are useful when:
You need to store large binary content but reduce database size
You want to take advantage of external storage redundancy and scaling
