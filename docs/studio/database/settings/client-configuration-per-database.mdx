* You can **override** the [server-wide client configuration](../../../studio/server/client-configuration.mdx) per database:  
  You can do this using:  
  * The Studio - as described in this article  
  * The Client API - see [Put client configuration operation](../../../client-api/operations/maintenance/configuration/put-client-configuration.mdx)  
    
* When set from the Studio, the client configuration is stored directly on the RavenDB server  
  and applies to any client that connects to the specific database.
   
* These settings override the client's own configuration,  
  which was initially set in your application code when initializing the _DocumentStore_.  
  This enables administrators to dynamically control client behavior, even after the client has started running.  
  For example, adjusting load balancing behavior on the fly in response to changing system demands.

* In this article:

## Set the client configuration (for database)

![Figure 1. Client Configuration Per Database](./assets/client-configuration-database-1.png)


**1. Identity parts separator**  

  * Changes the default **separator** for automatically generated document IDs.  
    You can use any `char` except `|` (pipe).  
    Default value: `/`  

**2. Max number of requests per session**  

  * Set this number to restrict the number of requests (***Reads*** & ***Writes***) per session in the client API.  
    Default value: 30  

**3. Use Session Context for Load Balancing**  

  * Allow client sessions to select their topology by tag, 
    so they'd be able to load-balance their requests.  
  
  * Optionally, select a hash seed to randomize the topology that clients would use.

  * For a detailed explanation see: [Load Balance Behavior](../../../client-api/configuration/load-balance/load-balance-behavior.mdx).

**4. Read balance behavior**  

  * Set the load-balance method that the client will use when accessing a node with ***Read*** requests.  
    The method selected will also affect the client's decision of which node to failover to in case of issues with the ***Read*** request.  
    Note: ***Write*** requests will always access the [preferred node](../../../client-api/configuration/load-balance/overview.mdx#the-preferred-node) calculated by the client.  

  * Available options are:  
     * _None_  
     * _Round Robin_  
     * _Fastest Node_  

  * For a detailed explanation see: [Read Balance Behavior](../../../client-api/configuration/load-balance/read-balance-behavior.mdx).

This view will be as in the above image when the general server [Client Configuration](../../../studio/server/client-configuration.mdx) is not yet defined.  
If a general server client-configuration is defined then this view will show the __effective configuration__ for the specific database.
