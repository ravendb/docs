* This view lists the __latest identities values__ that are set on the server for all collections where  
  an identity was created.

* You can edit existing values or set a new identity value for a collection.

* Identities values can also be managed from the Client API, see [seed identity operation](../../../client-api/operations/maintenance/identities/seed-identity.mdx).

* In this article:  
  * [What is an identity](../../../studio/database/documents/identities-view.mdx#what-is-an-identity)

## What is an identity

* An identity is a document ID generated automatically by the server when you provide an ID that ends with  
  a pipe symbol (`|`) during document creation.

* The identity ID is guaranteed to be **unique** in the database, across all nodes within the Database Group.

* The identity document ID (e.g., `employees/5`) is composed of:
  * The collection name (_empolyees_)  
  * A separator chrarcter, slash (`/`) by default.  
    You can customize this character, see [Customizing the separator character](../../../server/kb/document-identifier-generation.mdx#customizing-the-separator-character).  
  * A numeric value that is incremented per collection whenever a new identity document is created,  
    (_5_ in this example).

* Learn more about identities in:
  * [Document identifier generation - Identity ID](../../../server/kb/document-identifier-generation.mdx#identity-id)
  * [Working with document identifiers](../../../client-api/document-identifiers/working-with-document-identifiers.mdx#identities)

## The latest values

![Figure 1. Latest identities values](./assets/identities-view-1.png)

1. Navigate to **Documents &gt; Identities**

2. **Document ID Prefix**  

   * This string is the collection name for which an identity value was set:  
     either [via this view](../../../studio/database/documents/identities-view.mdx#add-new-identity), 
     or by creating a document with an identity ID as described [here](../../../client-api/document-identifiers/working-with-document-identifiers.mdx#identities).  
   
   * The string that shows is the collection name + a pipe suffix.  

3. **Latest Value**  

   * This is the latest identity value currently set on the server for the collection.
   
   * <Admonition type="info" title="">
      In this example - the latest value for the _employees_ collection is `3`.  
      This means the next document that will be created with an identity in the _employees_ collection  
      will get the ID `employees/4`.
     </Admonition> 

4. Click to edit the latest value.

5. Click to add a new identity value for another collection.

## Edit identity value

![Figure 2. Edit identity value](./assets/identities-view-2.png)

1. **Prefix**  
   The collection for which the value is edited.

2. **Value**  

   * Enter a number that will be set as the latest identity value for this collection.

   * In this example we set the value to `25`.  
     This means the next document that will be created with an identity in the _employees_ collection  
     will get the ID `employees/26`.

3. Click 'Update' to set the new value.

## Add new identity

![Figure 3. Add new identity](./assets/identities-view-3.png)

1. **Prefix**  

   * Enter the collection name for which to set an identity value.  
     (Using the pipe suffix here is optional, e.g. can enter "users" or "users|").
   
   * Note: you can specify a collection name that has not been created yet.  

2. **Value**

    * Enter a number that will be set as the latest identity value for this collection.

    * In this example we set the value to `99`.  
      This means the next document that will be created with an identity in the _users_ collection  
      will get the ID `users/100`.

3. Click 'Create' to create the new identity.
