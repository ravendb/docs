# Bundle: Compression

To reduce the cost of I/O operations and reduce the size of the database on disk, we have introduced the `Compression` bundle. Compression is only applied on documents, indexes are not compressed. This is because RavenDB is performing a lot of random reads from indexes, whereas with documents, we almost always read/write the full content. Worth noting is that compression process is fully transparent for the end-user.

## How to enable compression

To activate compression server-wide just add `Compression` to `Raven/ActiveBundles` configuration in global configuration file or setup new database with compression bundle turned on using API or Studio.

How to create a database with compression enabled using Studio can be found [here](../../../studio/bundles/compression.mdx).

<TabItem value="compression_1" label="compression_1">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`store.DatabaseCommands.CreateDatabase(new DatabaseDocument
\{
    Id = "CompressedDB",
    // Other configuration options omitted for simplicity
    Settings =
            \{
                // ...
                \{"Raven/ActiveBundles", "Compression"\}
            \}
\});
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

Above example demonstrates how to create new database called `CompressedDB` with `Compression` bundle enabled.

<Admonition type="note" title="">
Activating compression bundle is only supported for new databases. Activating or disabling compression on an already existing database will cause DB malfunction.
