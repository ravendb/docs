# Using the AWS Secrets Manager
The template supports using AWS Secrets Manager to store app configuration, 
including the X.509 certificate contents.  

<Admonition type="warning" title="AWS Secrets Manager Incurs a Cost" id="aws-secrets-manager-incurs-a-cost" href="#aws-secrets-manager-incurs-a-cost">
While AWS Secrets Manager is the most secure way to load a client certificate, 
it does incur a cost. Learn more about [how much it will cost to store secrets][aws-secrets-pricing] 
for your application.  

If you do not wish to use this method, you can still use the PEM certificate 
option using environment variables through the `RavenSettings.CertPublicKeyFilePath` 
and `RavenSettings.CertPrivateKey` settings.  
</Admonition>

Before continuing, make sure you have:  

- The [AWS CLI][aws-cli] installed  
- A configured AWS local environment  
- Your RavenDB client certificate with password (`.pfx` file) or PEM-encoded `.crt` and `.key` files  
- Your IAM role name used by your AWS Lambda function(s)  
- Your AWS account ID number  

## Storing RavenDB Secrets

For `RavenSettings` values, you can use the **Key/Value** JSON storage 
using a secret named `RavenSettings` that the Lambda function will load.  

Learn more about [adding secrets to Secrets Manager][aws-secrets-mgr-add].  

There are two ways to specify certificates using `RavenSettings`:  

### CertPem: Store PEM Certificate in Secrets Manager

The AWS template for RavenDB can load certificates through the 
`RavenSettings:CertPublicKeyFilePath` and `RavenSettings:CertPrivateKey` 
JSON configuration, supported through [X502Certificate2.CreateFromPem][dotnet-createfrompem].  

The `CertPublicKeyFilePath` JSON key should be set to the relative path to the `.crt` 
public key certificate, relative to the `.csproj` file. This should be copied to the 
output and publish directories automatically.  

The `CertPrivateKey` JSON key should be set to a value containing the [base64-encoded][tool-base64] 
contents of the `.key` file from the RavenDB client certificate package.  

**Example `RavenSettings` key configuration value:**  

<TabItem value="something" label="json">
<CodeBlock language="json">
{`\{
  // ... other settings
  "CertPublicKeyFilePath": "free.mycompany.client.certificate.crt",
  "CertPrivateKey": "LS0tLS1CRUdJTiBSU0EgUFJJVkFURSBLRVktLS0tLQpNSUlKS0FJLi4uCi0tLS0tRU5EIFJTQSBQUklWQVRFIEtFWS0tLS0t"
\}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

Settings will be _merged_ with `appsettings.json` configuration, 
so you only need to specify settings you wish to overwrite.  

### CertBytes: Store PFX Certificate in Secrets Manager

The AWS template for RavenDB can also load certificates through the `CertBytes` 
secret setting. This means the client certificate needs to be stored in binary 
in AWS Secrets Manager. In the Secrets Manager console, you can add JSON and 
plaintext secrets. Binary secrets must be uploaded through the AWS CLI.

<TabItem value="something" label="bash">
<CodeBlock language="bash">
{`aws secretsmanager create-secret \\
    --name RavenSettings.CertBytes \\
    --description "RavenDB Client Certificate file" \\
    --secret-binary file://free.mycompany.client.certificate.with.password.pfx
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

We then need to grant access to the IAM role used by the Lambda function (created above).  

#### Apply a Resource Policy

First, create a file `certpolicy.json` with the following AWS policy:

<TabItem value="something" label="json">
<CodeBlock language="json">
{`\{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    \{
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": \{
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::<ACCOUNT_ID>:role/<LAMBDA_FUNCTION_ROLE>"
      \},
      "Action": "secretsmanager:GetSecretValue",
      "Resource": "*"
    \}
  ]
\}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

Replace `<ACCOUNT_ID>` with your AWS account ID and `<LAMBDA_FUNCTION_ROLE>` with the 
above-created role assigned to the Lambda function.  

Next, use `aws secretsmanager put-resource-policy` command to set the resource policy 
while also verifying the secret is not broadly accessible:  

<TabItem value="something" label="bash">
<CodeBlock language="bash">
{`aws secretsmanager put-resource-policy \\
    --secret-id RavenSettings.CertBytes \\
    --resource-policy file://certpolicy.json \\
    --block-public-policy
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

The certificate file contents is now stored and will be accessed by the Lambda function on startup.  

### Verifying the Secret is Loaded

Test invoking the Lambda function again, which should access AWS Secrets Manager successfully 
and load the X.509 certificate to use with RavenDB.
