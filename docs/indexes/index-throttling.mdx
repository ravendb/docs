# Indexes: Index Throttling
<Admonition type="note" title="Note">

* **Index Throttling** delays indexing operations by a time interval of your choice.  
  Indexing is triggered normally when items are added or modified, but RavenDB suspends 
  index procession by the set interval.  
* The gaps in indexing activity and the procession of 
  [larger batches](../indexes/index-throttling#throttling-and-batches) 
  can reduce overall indexing CPU utilization.  
* Indexing can be throttled server-wide, per-database, and per-index.  
* Index throttling applies to the procession of **existing** indexes.  
  **New** indexes are processed sequentially without delay.

## Why Use Index Throttling?

Indexing a rapidly modified group of items (e.g. a time series, a group of counters, 
or a patched collection) can preoccupy RavenDB with lengthy consecutive indexing of 
small batches of items.  

![Throttles Index Performance View](./assets/index-throttling-01.png)

The Indexing Performance view shown above demonstrates the procession of a throttled index 
along the timeline, with a 1500 Milliseconds gap between consecutive batches.  
Throttling offers indexing-free time gaps that the database can use for other 
tasks and the procession of larger batches when indexing does take place.  

<Admonition type="info" title="Info">
Throttled indexes are kept [stale](../indexes/stale-indexes#indexes-stale-indexes) 
as long as their procession is incomplete.  
They are therefore expected to remain stale longer than indexes that are processed sequentially.  
</Admonition>



## Throttling and Batches

The delay in index procession increases the size of Item [batches](../server/configuration/indexing-configuration#indexing.mapbatchsize) 
that are processed during indexing intervals.  

In special cases, throttled indexes' batches are processed without delay.  

* The batch following a batch that cannot be processed for known reasons, will be processed 
  without delay.  
* Accumulated data (collected due to batch size configuration, for example) whose procession 
  requires multiple batches, will be processed with no delay between batches.  



## Setting Index Throttling
### Server-Wide Index Throttling

 Index Throttling can be set server-wide using a designated [configuration option](../server/configuration/configuration-options#settings.json).  
 Setting the server-wide configuration option will apply to all databases on a given node.  

* Set the index throttling time interval in Milliseconds using the `Indexing.Throttling.TimeIntervalInMs` configuration option, e.g.:  
  `"Indexing.Throttling.TimeIntervalInMs": "5000"`  
### Index Throttling Per-Database 

Enable or disable index throttling for a specific database using the designated database configuration key.  
Setting this property overrides the 
[Server-Wide](../indexes/index-throttling#server-wide-index-throttling) default.  
 
* **From Studio**:  

    ![Database Configuration Keys](./assets/index-throttling-02.png)

      1. Open **Settings** &gt; **Database Settings** view.  
      2. **Filter Keys** - Enter a search string to locate the configuration key.  
      3. **Edit** - Click to edit values (see next image for details).  
      4. **Configuration Key** -  
         `Indexing.Throttling.TimeIntervalInMs` - Index Throttling configuration key.  
      5. **Effective Value** - The current configuration.  
      6. **Origin** - The origin of the current configuration.  
         Can be - Default | Database  

    ![Edit Values](./assets/index-throttling-03.png)

      1. **Override** - Toggle to override the server-wide configuration.  
      2. **Edit Value** - Enter a new time in Milliseconds, or leave empty for null (no throttling).  
      3. **Set Default** - Click 'Set Default' to select the server-wide default value.  
      4. **Save** - Apply changes.  
         <Admonition type="warning" title="Warning">
         An edited configuration key's value will become effective only after the database is reloaded.  
         </Admonition>
### Index Throttling in an Index Definition

Setting throttling in an index definition overrides [server-wide](../indexes/index-throttling#server-wide-index-throttling) 
and [database](../indexes/index-throttling#index-throttling-per-database) settings configuration.  


* **From Code**:  
  Set throttling for a specific index using the `Indexing.Throttling.TimeIntervalInMs` property.  
<TabItem value="something-something" label="throttlingInterval">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`var index = new IndexDefinition
\{
    Name = "ByOrderedAt",
    Maps = \{"from o in orders select new \{o.OrderedAt\}"\},
    Configuration = new IndexConfiguration
    \{
        \{ "Indexing.Throttling.TimeIntervalInMs", "2000" \}
    \},
\};
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

    The batch size can be left for RavenDB to decide, or you can set it yourself using 
    the [Indexing.MapBatchSize](../server/configuration/indexing-configuration#indexing.mapbatchsize) property.  
<TabItem value="something-something" label="batchSize">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`Configuration = new IndexConfiguration
\{
    \{ "Indexing.Throttling.TimeIntervalInMs", "2000" \},
    \{ "Indexing.MapBatchSize", "50" \}
\},
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

* **From Studio**:  
  Use the [Configuration tab](../studio/database/indexes/create-map-index#configuration) of an index definition 
  to set the index's `Indexing.Throttling.TimeIntervalInMs` configuration key value in Milliseconds.  
  ![Configuration Key](./assets/index-throttling-04.png)
      1. ****Configuration Tab**** - Open to set index configuration keys.  
      2. **Add Customized Indexing Configuration** - Click to add a configuration key.  
      3. **Indexing Configuration Key** -  
         Type `Indexing.Throttling.TimeIntervalInMs` or select this key from the droplist to set index throttling.  
      4. **Value** - Type the throttling time interval in Milliseconds.
