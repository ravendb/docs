* All queries sent to the RavenDB server use RQL, RavenDB’s rich query language.  
  To learn more about RQL, see [What is RQL](../../querying/rql/what-is-rql.mdx).  

* **RQL Code Assistance** is a RavenDB Studio feature that helps you write RQL queries quickly and correctly  
  by providing context-aware auto-completion and real-time syntax checking.  
  While you type a query in Studio, RQL Code Assistance will:
  * Provide auto-completion (Ctrl+Space) for collections, document fields, indexes, functions, keywords, and operators relevant to your current query context.
  * Update suggestions as you write, showing valid options for the next part of the query.
  * Continuously check syntax and highlight errors with warning icons and detailed messages on hover.    

* **RQL Code Assistance** is available whenever you write a query in the following Studio views:
  * [Query view](../../studio/database/queries/query-view.mdx#query-view)
  * [Patch view](../../studio/database/documents/patch-view.mdx#patch-view)  
  * [Subscription task view](../../studio/database/tasks/ongoing-tasks/subscription-task.mdx#subscription-task-definition)

* In this article:  
  * [Auto-completion](../../querying/rql/rql-code-assistance.mdx#auto-completion)  
  * [Syntax verification](../../querying/rql/rql-code-assistance.mdx#syntax-verification)

* To invoke auto-completion, press **Ctrl+Space** while writing RQL.  
  The relevant options for the current cursor location will be listed.
    
* Clicking a list item will add it to the query.  
  At the very beginning of a query, the suggested options will be the most basic ones:
  * [from](../../querying/rql/what-is-rql.mdx#from) - to select a collection to query on  
  * [from index](../../querying/rql/what-is-rql.mdx#query-an-index--from-index-index-name) - to select an index to query on  
  * [declare function](../../querying/rql/what-is-rql.mdx#declare) - to create a JavaScript function

<Panel heading="Syntax verification">

* As you write your query, its syntax is continuously verified and errors are detected.  
* When an error is detected, a warning sign is displayed on the left side of the editor.  
* Hovering over the warning sign shows the error details.
