# Manage Your Server: Server Permissions

As described in [Configuration : Authentication & Authorization](../../server/configuration/authentication-and-authorization.mdx), you can use two different authentication methods in RavenDB.   
In both methods, each user is associated with a permission type:   
- `Admin`   
- `Read, Write`   
- `Read Only`   

The permission type is set by an admin when creating user settings in [Windows Authentication](./windows-authentication) or when using [API keys](./api-keys).

### Permissions to system database

Permissions to the system database describe which management sections a user can access.
The following table shows the sections of the studio management and their associated permissions:

| Studio management section| Write | Read |
|:-------------------------|:------|:-----|
| API keys                 | write | read |
| windows authentication   | write | read |
