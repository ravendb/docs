# RavenDB on the Cloud: Tiers and Instances

{NOTE: }

Use your portal's [Products tab](../cloud/portal/cloud-portal-products-tab) to raise or modify 
a Free node, a Development node, or a Production cluster.  
Free and Development nodes, as well as Production "basic" grade clusters, are operated by 
[burstable instances](../cloud/cloud-overview#burstable-vs.-reserved-clusters).  
The higher production-cluster grades [Standard](../cloud/cloud-instances#standard-grade-production-cluster) 
and [Performance](../cloud/cloud-instances#performance-grade-production-cluster) are 
[Reserved clusters](../cloud/cloud-overview#burstable-vs.-reserved-clusters).  

* In this page:  
    * [A Free Cloud Node](../cloud/cloud-instances#a-free-cloud-node)  
    * [A Development Cloud Server](../cloud/cloud-instances#a-development-cloud-server)  
    * [A Production Cloud Cluster](../cloud/cloud-instances#a-production-cloud-cluster)  
       - [Basic-grade Production Cluster](../cloud/cloud-instances#basic-grade-production-cluster)  
       - [Standard-grade Production Cluster](../cloud/cloud-instances#standard-grade-production-cluster)

### A Free Cloud Node  

Free RavenDB cloud nodes are great for experiments and evaluation. They are equipped with the 
most basic configuration and capabilities and have a single node and no Service-level agreement (SLA).  
You can run only one free node per [account](../cloud/cloud-overview#your-account).  

To raise a free cloud node, use the [Products tab](../cloud/portal/cloud-portal-products-tab) 
to create a **free**-tier instance.  
!["Tiers and Instances: Free"](images\tiers-and-instances-001-free.png "Tiers and Instances: Free")  

* A free instance is identical to a development [Dev10](../cloud/cloud-instances#a-development-cloud-server) instance.  
  It comes with a monthly credit of **10$**, used to cover the cost of the instance and incidentals like backup storage 
  and traffic.  
  {NOTE: }
  If your free instance is using more resources than the provided credit, you'll need to pay for these resources or stop your instance. 
  {NOTE/}

* The free instance is limited to the [community](https://ravendb.net/buy) subset of features.  

* If you don't use a free instance for over 14 days, it will be deleted.

### A Development Cloud Server  

A development server is equipped with all RavenDB's features, like Pull Replication and Encrypted Databases.  

Such cloud servers are perfect for development, though not for production because of their single-node configuration, 
[burstable](../cloud/cloud-overview#burstable-instances) CPU usage and lack of 
[backup](../cloud/cloud-backup-and-restore#cloud-backup) procedure and [SLA](../cloud/portal/cloud-portal-support-tab#support-entitlement).  

To raise a cloud Development server, create a product using the Products tab and choose the **development** tier.  
!["Tiers and Instances: Development"](images\tiers-and-instances-002-development.png "Tiers and Instances: Development")

####Select your server's configuration  
  
Choose from the increasingly powerful configurations Dev10 to Dev70  
!["Development Tier DEV10"](images\tiers-and-instances-0021-development-dev10.png "Development Tier DEV10")  
!["Development Tier DEV70"](images\tiers-and-instances-0022-development-dev70.png "Development Tier DEV70")  

---

####Select your storage  

Choose your storage type and size  
!["Development Tier: Storage"](images\tiers-and-instances-0023-development-storage.png "Development Tier: Storage")  

{INFO: }
In addition to the CPU / memory resources allocated to your instances, you can select the type of storage that will 
be assigned to your RavenDB instances. It is fairly obvious why the size of the storage matters, but it is important 
to also understand the impact of the storage type and allocated IOPS on the overall performance.  

RavenDB, as a database, is sensitive to I/O latencies resulting from slow storage. If your instances are running into 
high I/O latencies, RavenDB will alert you to the issue so you can upgrade the type of storage you are using and the 
number of IOPS reserved for your instances.

### A Production Cloud Cluster  

The default production configuration is a three-node cluster, provisioned in separate 
availability zones for maximum durability.  
{NOTE: }
RavenDB Cloud also offers **multi-region clusters** and clusters with a **higher number of nodes**.  
Contact Support to provision clusters with configurations that suit your needs.
{NOTE/}
!["Production Tier"](images\tiers-and-instances-003-production.png "Production Tier")  

The production tier offers three instance levels:  
1. **Basic**  
2. **Standard**  
3. **Performance**  
  
---
  
####1. Basic-grade Production Cluster
Basic production clusters are [burstable](../cloud/cloud-overview#burstable-instances).  
While suitable for low to medium workloads, they trade-off peak efficiency for lower costs.  
!["Production: Basic"](images\tiers-and-instances-0031-production-basic.png "Production: Basic")  

---

####2. Standard-grade Production Cluster
The resources of standard production clusters are [reserved](../cloud/cloud-overview#reserved-clusters).  
The cluster can utilize them at all times, and is equipped to handle constant production load.  

Use the slide bars to choose your Standard Production cluster's configuration and storage.  
!["Production: Standard P10"](images\tiers-and-instances-0032-production-standard-P10.png "Production: Standard P10")  
!["Production: Standard P50"](images\tiers-and-instances-0033-production-standard-P50.png "Production: Standard P50")  
!["Standard Storage"](images\tiers-and-instances-0034-production-standard-storage.png "Standard Storage")  

{INFO: }
In addition to the CPU / memory resources allocated to your instances, you can select the type of storage that will 
be assigned to your RavenDB instances. It is fairly obvious why the size of the storage matters, but it is important 
to also understand the impact of the storage type and allocated IOPS on the overall performance.  

RavenDB, as a database, is sensitive to I/O latencies resulting from slow storage. If your instances are running into 
high I/O latencies, RavenDB will alert you to the issue so you can upgrade the type of storage you are using and the 
number of IOPS reserved for your instances.  
{INFO/}

####3. Performance-grade Production Cluster
Performance cloud clusters are [reserved](../cloud/cloud-overview#reserved-clusters), and we can 
**custom-tailor** them for your production environment needs so they include High memory, reserved IO with NVMe drives, 
High compute, and terabytes of storage space.  
!["Production: Performance"](images\tiers-and-instances-0034-production-performance.png "Production: Performance")  

{NOTE: }
The production tier is **highly customizable**.  
Contact Support to modify your server configuration, the number of nodes in your cluster, 
and various parameters of their deployment.  
If you're interested in high global availability, for example, a multi-region deployment 
can be easily set and would probably suit you better than the default arrangement.
