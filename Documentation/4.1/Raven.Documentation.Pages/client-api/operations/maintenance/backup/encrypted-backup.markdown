# Backup Encryption  

---

{NOTE: }

* The snapshot of an encrypted database is encrypted as well.  
  The snapshot of an unencrypted database is not uncrypted.  
* Logical-backup encryption is **not** supported by RavenDB 4.0 and 4.1.

####RavenDB's Security Approach

Encrypting backup files is just **one respect** of RavenDB's comprehensive security approach.  
Other respects are implemented in -

* [Database encryption](../../../../server/security/encryption/database-encryption)  
* Securing server-client communication using [Authentication and certification](../../../../server/security/authentication/certificate-configuration).  

---

####Enable Secure Communication

RavenDB emphasizes the importance of overall security, by allowing encryption of the database only when 
server-client communication is [authenticated and certified](../../../../server/security/overview).  

* **Enabling authentication and certification**  
  Enable secure client-server communication during the server setup, either [manually](../../../../server/security/authentication/certificate-configuration) or [using the setup-wizard](../../../../start/installation/setup-wizard).  

* **Client authentication procedure**  
  When authentication is enabled, clients are required to certify themselves in order to connect the server.  
  Here's a code sample for this procedure:  
{CODE encrypted_database@ClientApi\Operations\Maintenance\Backup\Backup.cs /}

####Creating an Encrypted Snapshot

A [snapshot](../../../../client-api/operations/maintenance/backup/backup#snapshot) is an exact copy of the database files. 
If the database is encrypted, so would be its snapshot. If the database is **not** encrypted, the snapshot wouldn't be either.  

* If you want your snapshot to be encrypted, take the snapshot of an [encrypted database](../../../../server/security/encryption/database-encryption#creating-an-encrypted-database-using-the-rest-api-and-the-client-api).  
* Include the [client authentication procedure](../../../../client-api/operations/maintenance/backup/encrypted-backup#enable-secure-communication) in your code.  
* Create a snapshot [as you normally would](../../../../client-api/operations/maintenance/backup/backup#backup-types).  

{NOTE: The incremental backups of an encrypted snapshot are **not** encrypted.}

####Restoring an Encrypted Snapshot

Restoring an encrypted snapshot is almost identical to restoring an unencrypted one.  

* Include the [client authentication procedure](../../../../client-api/operations/maintenance/backup/encrypted-backup#enable-secure-communication) in your code.  
* Pass RestoreBackupOperation an encryption key, using `restoreConfiguration.EncryptionKey`.  
   Use **the same secret key used to encrypt the database**.
* Code sample:
{CODE restore_encrypted_database@ClientApi\Operations\Maintenance\Backup\Backup.cs /}
