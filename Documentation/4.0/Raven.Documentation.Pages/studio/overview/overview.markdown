## Studio Overview
---

{PANEL}
RavenDB comes with a Management Studio that can be accessed by any modern browser using the server URL     
(e.g. http://localhost:8080/ - when your server runs at port 8080). 

The Studio lets you manage your server, databases, indexes, issue queries,  
perform maintenance actions, view various stats graphs and logs, define tasks, import & export data, and much more,    
all in a very easy manner.

The Studio can be accessed on any RavenDB server regardless of how it is deployed.
