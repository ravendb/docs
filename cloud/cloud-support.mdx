| **Severity** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Minor        | Non-critical errors, general questions, requests for enhancements to the Software.                                                                                                                                                              |
| Normal       | Use when the error is not critical - no data has been lost, and the system has not failed. The error has been identified and does not prevent normal operation, or the situation may be temporarily circumvented using an available workaround. |
| Critical     | Use when due to an error in a production environment, the Software is down or seriously impacted, or there is no workaround currently available, or the workaround is cumbersome to use, or the Customer data is lost or destroyed.             |

| **Response**      | **Description**                                                                     |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Standard          | Response time may vary depending on demand and may take up to several working days. |
| Next business day | Reply within a next business day.                                                   |
| Within 2 hours    | Your query will be responded to within two hours.                                   |
