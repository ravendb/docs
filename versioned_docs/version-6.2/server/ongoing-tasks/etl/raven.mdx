# Ongoing Tasks: RavenDB ETL  
<Admonition type="note" title="Note">

* **RavenDB ETL Task** creates an [ETL](../../../server/ongoing-tasks/etl/basics) 
  process for a given database when the destination is another RavenDB database.  

* The script is executed per document whenever the document is created, modified, and/or deleted.  

* It can be defined in code or using the [Studio](../../../studio/database/tasks/ongoing-tasks/ravendb-etl-task).  

* One RavenDB ETL task can have multiple transformation scripts and each script can load to a different collection.  

* Each script can be defined on the source database to trigger ETL from a single collection, 
  multiple selected collections or be applied to **all** documents regardless of the associated collection(s).  

* For the destination cluster to trust the source, you must [pass the .pfx certificate from the source to the destination cluster](../../../server/security/authentication/certificate-management#enabling-communication-between-servers:-importing-and-exporting-certificates)
  if you are running a secure server.

* [Loading Documents](../../../server/ongoing-tasks/etl/raven#loading-documents)
* [Alternative Syntax](../../../server/ongoing-tasks/etl/raven#alternative-syntax)
* [Documents Identifiers](../../../server/ongoing-tasks/etl/raven#documents-identifiers)

* [Loading Data from Other Documents](../../../server/ongoing-tasks/etl/raven#loading-data-from-other-documents)
* [Accessing Metadata](../../../server/ongoing-tasks/etl/raven#accessing-metadata)
* [Creating Multiple Documents from a Single Document](../../../server/ongoing-tasks/etl/raven#creating-multiple-documents-from-a-single-document)
### Loading Documents

* To load data to the destination database you must call the `loadTo<CollectionName>()` method and pass a JS object.  

* Indicating the collection name in the load method is a convention.  

* The objects passed to the `loadTo` method will be sent to the target database in the last stage - `Load`.  

* All results created in a single ETL run will be sent in a single batch and processed transactionally in the destination.

   * For example, if you want to write data to the `Employees` collection you need to call the following method in the script body:
<TabItem value="something" label="javascript">
<CodeBlock language="javascript">
{`loadToEmployees(\{ ... \});
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

* The method parameter must be a JS object. You can create it as follows:
<TabItem value="something" label="javascript">
<CodeBlock language="javascript">
{`loadToEmployees(\{
    Name: this.FirstName + " " + this.LastName
\});
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

* Or simply transform the current document object and pass it:
<TabItem value="something" label="javascript">
<CodeBlock language="javascript">
{`this.Name = this.FirstName + " " + this.LastName;

delete this.Address;
delete this.FirstName;
delete this.LastName;

loadToEmployees(this);
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

#### Example: loadTo Method

The following is an example of a RavenDB ETL script processing documents from the `Employees` collection:

<TabItem value="something" label="javascript">
<CodeBlock language="javascript">
{`var managerName = null;

if (this.ReportsTo !== null)
\{
    var manager = load(this.ReportsTo);
    managerName = manager.FirstName + " " + manager.LastName;
\}

// load documents to \`Employees\` collection in the destination
loadToEmployees(\{
    // the loaded documents will have these fields:
    Name: this.FirstName + " " + this.LastName,
    Title: this.Title,
    BornOn: new Date(this.Birthday).getFullYear(),
    Manager: managerName
\});
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
<Admonition type="note" title="Note">
### Alternative Syntax

The target collection name can be passed to the `loadTo` command separately, as a string argument, 
using this syntax: `loadTo('Target', obj)`  

* **Example**:  
  The following two calls to `loadTo` are equivalent.  
  `loadToEmployees(this);`  
  `loadTo('Employees', this);`  

<Admonition type="info" title="Info">

 * The target name `'Employees'` in this syntax is **not** a variable and **cannot** be used as one: 
   it is simply a string literal of the target's name.  
 * Separating the target name from the `loadTo` command makes it possible to include symbols like 
   `-` and `.` in target names. This is not possible when the standard `loadToEmployees` syntax is 
   used because including special characters in the name of a JS function turns it invalid.  
</Admonition>
</Admonition>
### Documents Identifiers

The documents generated in the destination database are given an ID according to the collection name specified in the `loadTo` method.  

**If the specified destination collection is the _same_ as the source** 
then the document is loaded to the _same_ collection and the original identifier is preserved.  

   * For example, the following ETL script defined in the `Employees` collection will keep the same identifiers in the target database:  
<TabItem value="something" label="javascript">
<CodeBlock language="javascript">
{`// original ID will be preserved
loadToEmployees(\{ ... \});
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

**If the 'loadTo' method indicates a _different_ destination collection**, e.g. `People`,  
  then the `Employees` documents will get new identifiers that combine the original ID and the new collection name in the destination database.  

  This forces us to load new documents with incremented IDs instead of overwriting the fields in existing documents.  

  By default, RavenDB deletes the old document version in the destination.  
  This can be changed by changing the [deletions behavior](../../../server/ongoing-tasks/etl/raven#deletions). 

  RavenDB has to create a new, updated document in the destination with an [incremented server-made identity](../../../client-api/document-identifiers/working-with-document-identifiers#server-side-generated-ids).
  
  * For example, if the source collection is `Employees` while the destination collection is `People`:
<TabItem value="something" label="javascript">
<CodeBlock language="javascript">
{`// a new document with a new, incremented identifier will be generated in destination 
// by default, the old version will be deleted
loadToPeople(\{ ... \});
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

* In addition, ETL appends the symbol `/` to the requested id so that the target database will [generate identifiers on its side](../../../client-api/document-identifiers/working-with-document-identifiers#server-side-generated-ids). 
  As a result, documents in the `People` collection in the target database will have identifiers such as: `employees/1-A/people/00000000000000000024-A`.
### Filtering

Documents can be filtered from the ETL by calling the `loadTo` method only for documents that match some condition:

<TabItem value="something" label="javascript">
<CodeBlock language="javascript">
{`if (this.Active) \{
    // load only active users
    loadToEmployees(\{ ... \});
\}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
### Loading Data from Other Documents

The `load` method loads a document with the specified ID into the script context so it can be transformed.  

<TabItem value="something" label="javascript">
<CodeBlock language="javascript">
{`// this.ReportsTo has some document ID
var manager = load(this.ReportsTo);
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
### Accessing Metadata

The metadata can be accessed in the following way:

<TabItem value="something" label="javascript">
<CodeBlock language="javascript">
{`var value = this['@metadata']['custom-metadata-key'];
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
### Creating Multiple Documents from a Single Document

The `loadTo` method can be called multiple times in a single script.  
  That allows you to split a single source document into multiple documents on the destination database:

<TabItem value="something" label="javascript">
<CodeBlock language="javascript">
{`// documents will be created in \`Addresses\` collection
loadToAddresses(\{
    City: this.Address.City ,
    Country: this.Address.Country ,
    Address: this.Address.Line1
\});

delete this.Address;

// documents will be created in the \`Employees\` collection
loadToEmployees(this);
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>



## Empty Script

* An ETL task can be created with an empty script.  
* The documents will be transferred _without_ any modifications to the _same_ collection as the source document.  


## Attachments

* Attachments are sent automatically when you send a _full_ collection to the destination using an _empty_ script.  
* If you use a script you can indicate that an attachment should also be sent by using dedicated functions:

   - `loadAttachment(name)` returns a reference to an attachment that is meant be passed to `addAttachment()`
   - `<doc>.addAttachment([name,] attachmentRef)` adds an attachment to a document that will be sent in the process, `<doc>` is a reference returned by `loadTo<CollectionName>()`
* [Sending attachments together with documents](../../../server/ongoing-tasks/etl/raven#sending-attachments-together-with-documents)
* [Changing attachment name](../../../server/ongoing-tasks/etl/raven#changing-attachment-name)
* [Loading non-existent attachment](../../../server/ongoing-tasks/etl/raven#loading-non-existent-attachment)
* [Accessing attachments from metadata](../../../server/ongoing-tasks/etl/raven#accessing-attachments-from-metadata)
### Sending attachments together with documents

* Attachment is sent along with a transformed document if it's explicitly defined in the script by using `addAttachment()` method. By default, the attachment name is preserved.
* The script below sends _all_ attachments of a current document by taking advantage of `getAttachments()` function, loads each of them during transformation, and adds them to
  a document that will be sent to the 'Users' collection on the destination database.
<TabItem value="something" label="javascript">
<CodeBlock language="javascript">
{`var doc = loadToUsers(this);

var attachments = getAttachments();

for (var i = 0; i < attachments.length; i++) \{
    doc.addAttachment(loadAttachment(attachments[i].Name));
\}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
### Changing attachment name

* If `addAttachment()` is called with two arguments, the first one can indicate a new name for an attachment. In the below example attachment `photo`
  will be sent and stored under the `picture` name.
* To check the existence of an attachment `hasAttachment()` function is used
<TabItem value="something" label="javascript">
<CodeBlock language="javascript">
{`var employee = loadToEmployees(\{
    Name: this.FirstName + " " + this.LastName
\});

if (hasAttachment('photo')) \{
  employee.addAttachment('picture', loadAttachment('photo'));
\}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
### Loading non-existent attachment

Function `loadAttachment()` returns `null` if a document doesn't have an attachment with a given name. Passing such reference to `addAttachment()` will be no-op and no error will be thrown.
### Accessing attachments from metadata

The collection of attachments of the currently transformed document can be accessed either by `getAttachments()` helper function or directly from document metadata:

<TabItem value="something" label="javascript">
<CodeBlock language="javascript">
{`var attachments = this['@metadata']['@attachments'];
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>



## Counters

* Counters are sent automatically when you send a _full_ collection to the destination using an _empty_ script.
* If a script is defined RavenDB doesn't send counters by default.
* To indicate that a counter should also be sent, the [behavior function](../../../server/ongoing-tasks/etl/raven#counter-behavior-function) 
  (e.g. by increment operation). If the relevant function doesn't exist, a counter isn't loaded.
* The reason that counters require special functions is that incrementing a counter _doesn't_ modify the change vector of a related document so the document _isn't_ processed
  by ETL on a change in the counter.
* Another option of sending a counter is to explicitly add it in a script to a loaded document.
* [Counter behavior function](../../../server/ongoing-tasks/etl/raven#counter-behavior-function)
* [Adding counter explicitly in a script](../../../server/ongoing-tasks/etl/raven#adding-counter-explicitly-in-a-script)
### Counter behavior function

* Every time a counter of a document from a collection that ETL script is defined on is modified then the behavior function is called to check
  if the counter should be loaded to a destination database.

<Admonition type="info" title="Important" id="important" href="#important">

The counter behavior function can be defined _only_ for counters of documents from collections that are ETLed to _the same_ collections e.g.: 
a script is defined on `Products` collection and it loads documents to `Products` collection in a destination database using `loadToProducts()` method. 

</Admonition>

The function is defined in the script and should have the following signature:

<TabItem value="something" label="javascript">
<CodeBlock language="javascript">
{`function loadCountersOf<CollectionName>Behavior(docId, counterName) \{
   return [true | false]; 
\}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| **docId** | `string` | The identifier of a deleted document. |
| **&lt;CollectionName&gt;** | `string` | The collection that the ETL script is working on. |
| **counterName** | `string` | The name of the modified counter for that doc. |

| Return | Description |
| - | - |
| **bool** | If the function returns `true` then a change value is propagated to a destination. |

#### Example: Modifying a Counter Named "downloads"

The following script is defined on the `Products` collection:

<TabItem value="something" label="javascript">
<CodeBlock language="javascript">
{`if (this.Category == 'software') \{
    loadToProducts(\{
        ProductName: this.Name
    \});
\}

function loadCountersOfProductsBehavior(docId, counterName) \{
   var doc = load(docId);

   if (doc.Category == 'software' && counterName = 'downloads')
        return true;
\}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
### Adding counter explicitly in a script

Counter behavior functions typically handle counters of documents 
  that are loaded to the same collection. If a transformation script for `Employees`
  collection specifies that they are loaded to the `People` collection in a target database, 
  then due to document ID generation strategy by ETL process (see [Documents Identifiers](../../../server/ongoing-tasks/etl/raven#documents-identifiers)),
  the counters won't be sent because the final ID of a loaded document isn't known on the source side.  
  
  You can use special functions in the script code to deal with counters on documents that are loaded into different collections:

<TabItem value="something" label="javascript">
<CodeBlock language="javascript">
{`var person = loadToPeople(\{ Name: this.Name + ' ' + this.LastName \});

person.addCounter(loadCounter('likes'));
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

* The above example indicates that the `likes` counter will be sent together with a document. It uses the following functions to accomplish that:
  - `loadCounter(name)` returns a reference to a counter that is meant be passed to `addCounter()`
  - `<doc>.addCounter(counterRef)` adds a counter to a document that will be sent in the process, `<doc>` is a reference returned by `loadTo<CollectionName>()`

  <Admonition type="info" title="Important" id="important" href="#important">

   As the transformation script is run on a document update then counters added explicitly (`addCounter()`) will be loaded along with documents _only_ if the document is changed.
   It means that incremented counter value won't be sent until a document is modified and the ETL process will run the transformation for it.

  </Admonition>
 

<Admonition type="note" title="Counter value override by ETL" id="counter-value-override-by-etl" href="#counter-value-override-by-etl">

Counters sent by the ETL process always _override_ the existing value on the destination. ETL doesn't send an `increment` counter command 
but it **sets the value using a** `put` command.

</Admonition>



## Time Series

* If the transformation script is empty, time series are transferred along with their 
documents by default.  
* When the script is not empty, ETL can be set for time series via:  
  * [Time Series Load Behavior Function](../../../server/ongoing-tasks/etl/raven#time-series-load-behavior-function) 
  * [Adding Time Series to Documents](../../../server/ongoing-tasks/etl/raven#adding-time-series-to-documents)
### Time Series Load Behavior Function

* The time-series behavior function is defined in the script to set the conditions under 
which time-series data is loaded.  
* The load behavior function evaluates each [time-series segment](../../../document-extensions/timeseries/design#segmentation) 
and decides whether to load it to the destination database. ETL only updates the data 
that has changed: if only one time-series entry is modified, only the segment that 
entry belongs to is evaluated.  
* Changes to time-series trigger ETL on both the time-series itself and on the document 
it extends.  
* The function returns either a boolean or an object with two `Date` values that 
specify the range of time-series entries to load.  
* The time-series behavior function can _only_ be applied to time-series whose source 
collection and target collection have the same name. Loading a time-series from an 
Employees collection on the server-side to a Users collection at the target database 
is not possible using the load behavior function.  
* The function should be defined with the following signature:  
<TabItem value="something" label="java">
<CodeBlock language="java">
{`function loadTimeSeriesOf<collection name>Behavior(docId, timeSeriesName) \{
   return [ true | false | <span of time> ];
\}
//"span of time" refers to this type: \{ string?: from, string?: to \}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| **\&lt;collection name&gt;** | A part of the function's name | Determines which collection's documents this behavior function applies to. A function named `loadTimeSeriesOfEmployeesBehavior` will apply on all time-series in the collection `Employees` |
| **docId** | `string` | This parameter is used inside the function to refer to the documents' ID |
| **timeSeriesName** | `string` | This parameter is used inside the function to refer to the time series' name |

| Return Value | Description |
| - | - |
| `true` | If the behavior function returns `true`, the given time series segment is loaded. |
| `false` | The given time series segment is not loaded |
| **\&lt;span of time&gt;** | An object with two optional `Date` values: `from` and `to`. If this is the return value, the script loads the time series entries between these two times. If you leave `from` or `to` undefined they default to the start or end of the time series respectively. |

#### Example

The following script is defined in the `Companies` collection. The behavior function loads 
each document in the collection into the script context using `load(docId)`, then filters 
by the document's `Address.Country` property as well as the time series' name. This 
sends only stock price data for French companies.  
<TabItem value="something" label="javascript">
<CodeBlock language="javascript">
{`loadToCompanies(this);

function loadTimeSeriesOfCompaniesBehavior(docId, timeSeriesName) \{
   var company = load(docId);

   if (company.Address.Country == 'France' && timeSeriesName = 'StockPrices')
        return true;
\}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
### Adding Time Series to Documents

* Time series can be loaded into the script context using `loadTimeSeries()`.  
* Once a time series is loaded into the script, it can be added to a document using 
`AddTimeSeries()`.  
<TabItem value="something" label="javascript">
<CodeBlock language="javascript">
{`var employee = loadToEmployees(\{
    Name: this.Name + ' ' + this.LastName
\});

employee.addTimeSeries(loadTimeSeries('StockPrices'));
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

<Admonition type="warning" title="Warning">
When using `addTimeSeries`, `addAttachment`, and\or `addCounter`, ETL deletes and 
replaces the existing documents at the destination database, including all time 
series, counters, and attachments.  
</Admonition>

<Admonition type="info" title="Info">
Since the transformation script is run on document update, time series added to 
documents using `addTimeSeries()` will be loaded _only_ when the document they 
extend has changed.  
</Admonition>
#### Filtering by start and end date

Both the behavior function and `loadTimeSeries()` accept a start and end date as 
second and third parameters. If these are set, only time-series data within this 
time span is loaded to the destination database.  

<TabItem value="something" label="javascript">
<CodeBlock language="javascript">
{`company.addTimeSeries(loadTimeSeries('StockPrices', new Date(2020, 3, 26), new Date(2020, 3, 28)));
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="something" label="javascript">
<CodeBlock language="javascript">
{`function loadTimeSeriesOfUsersBehavior(doc, ts)
\{
    return \{
        from: new Date(2020, 3, 26),
        to: new Date(2020, 3, 28)
    \};
\};
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>



## Revisions

Revisions are _not_ sent by the ETL process.  

But, if revisions are configured on the destination database, then when the target document is overwritten by the ETL process a revision will be created as expected.  


## Deletions

Upon source document modifications, ETL is set to delete and replace the destination documents by default.  

If you want to control the way deletions are handled in the destination database, 
you can change the default settings with the configurable functions described in this section.

* [Why documents are deleted by default](../../../server/ongoing-tasks/etl/raven#deletions-why-documents-are-deleted-by-default-in-the-destination-database)
* [When destination collections are different](../../../server/ongoing-tasks/etl/raven#when-destination-collections-are-different)
* [Collection specific function](../../../server/ongoing-tasks/etl/raven#deletions-collection-specific-function)
* [Generic function](../../../server/ongoing-tasks/etl/raven#deletions-generic-function)
* [Filtering deletions in the destination database](../../../server/ongoing-tasks/etl/raven#deletions-filtering-deletions-in-the-destination-database)
* [Deletions Example: ETL script with deletion behavior defined](../../../server/ongoing-tasks/etl/raven#deletions-example-etl-script-with-deletion-behavior-defined)

## Deletions: Why documents are deleted by default in the destination database

### Preventing duplication

To prevent duplication, we delete the documents in the destination by default before loading the 
updated documents that replace the deleted ones.  
If the document is deleted in the source, RavenDB also deletes it in the destination by default.

Some developers prefer to control the deletes so that, for example, a delete in the source will not cause a delete in the destination, 
or to preserve a history of the document in the destination.  

The functions in this section were created to allow developers this control. 

### When destination collections are different

**If we ETL to a different collection than the source**,  
the source isn't aware of the new IDs created. 
This forces us to load new documents with incremented IDs instead of overwriting the fields in existing documents.  
RavenDB has to create a new, updated document in the destination with an [incremented server-made identity](../../../server/ongoing-tasks/etl/raven#documents-identifiers).  
You can then choose if you want to delete the old version in the destination by selecting 
`return false` in the transform script function [deleteDocumentsBehavior](../../../server/ongoing-tasks/etl/raven#deletions-generic-function). 

* Each updated version of the document gets a [server generated ID](../../../client-api/document-identifiers/working-with-document-identifiers#server-side-generated-ids)
  in which the number at the end is incremented with each version.  

    For example: 
    `"...profile/0000000000000000019-B"` will become `".../profile/0000000000000000020-B"`  
    The word before the number is the collection name and the letter after the number is the node.  
    In this case, the document's collection is "Profile", which is in a database in node "B", 
    and which has been updated via ETL 20 times.

* If the ETL is defined to load the documents to more than one collection, 
  by default it will delete, and if it's not deleted in the source, it will replace all of the documents with the same prefix.  

     For example:  
     Document `employees/1-A` is processed by ETL and put into the `People` and `Sales` collections with IDs:  
     `employees/1-A/people/0000000000000000001-A` and `employees/1-A/sales/0000000000000000001-A`.  
     Deletion or modification of the `employees/1-A` document on the source side triggers sending a command that deletes **all** documents 
     having the following prefix in their ID: `employees/1-A`.  

**If we load a document to the same collection as the source**,  
then the ID is preserved and no special approach is needed. Deletion in the source results in 
sending a single delete command in the destination for a given ID.  
If documents are updated and not deleted in the source, they will simply be updated in the destination with no change to the destination document ID. 
Deletions can be controlled by defining deletion behavior functions in the ETL script.

* See a [sample ETL script with deletion behavior defined](../../../server/ongoing-tasks/etl/raven#deletions-example-etl-script-with-deletion-behavior-defined).

## Deletions: Collection specific function

### Syntax

<TabItem value="something" label="javascript">
<CodeBlock language="javascript">
{`function deleteDocumentsOf<CollectionName>Behavior(docId, deleted) \{
    if (deleted == false) 
    return <bool>
\}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

`<CollectionName>` needs to be substituted by a real collection name that the ETL script is working on (same convention as for [loadTo](../../../server/ongoing-tasks/etl/raven#transformation-script-options) 
method).  
e.g. `function deleteDocumentsOfOrdersBehavior(docId, deleted) {return false;}`  

| Parameter | Type | Description | Notes |
| - | - | - | - |
| **docId** | `string` | The identifier of a deleted document. |  |
| **deleted** | `bool` | If you don't include the `deleted` parameter, RavenDB will execute the function without checking if the document was deleted from the source database. 
 If you include `deleted`, RavenDB will check if the document was indeed deleted or just updated. | Optional |

| Return Value | Description |
| - | - |
| **true** | The document will be deleted from the destination database. |
| **false** | The document will not be deleted from the destination database. |

### Example - Collection Specific Deletion Behavior Function

To define deletion handling when the source and destination collections are the same, use the following sample. 
If you ETL to a different collection than the source, there is a different deletion behavior in the destination.

<TabItem value="something" label="javascript">
<CodeBlock language="javascript">
{`function deleteDocumentsOfproductsHistoryBehavior(docId, deleted) \{
    // If any document in the specified source collection is modified but is not deleted,  
    // then the ETL will not send a delete command to the destination.  
    if (deleted === false) 
    return false; 
    // If the source document was deleted, the destination will also be deleted 
    else return true;
\}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

Leaving out the `deleted` parameter will not allow you to check if the source document was deleted and will 
trigger the command regardless of whether the source document was deleted.  

## Deletions: Generic function

There is also a generic function to control deletion on different collections.

### Syntax

<TabItem value="something" label="javascript">
<CodeBlock language="javascript">
{`function deleteDocumentsBehavior(docId, collection, deleted) \{

    if (collection === "string" && deleted === <bool>) 
        return <bool>; 
\}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| **docId** | `string` | The identifier of a deleted document. |
| **collection** | `string` | The name of a collection that ETL is working on. |
| **deleted** | `bool` | Optional and therefore doesn't affect existing code. If you don't include the `deleted` parameter, RavenDB will execute the function without checking if the document was deleted from the source database. 
 If you include `deleted`, RavenDB will check if the document was indeed deleted or just updated. 

| Return Value | Description |
| - | - |
| **true** | The document will be deleted from the destination database. |
| **false** | The document will not be deleted from the destination database. |


Leaving out the `deleted` parameter will not allow you to check if the source document was deleted and will 
trigger the command regardless of whether the source document was deleted.  


### Example - Generic deletions behavior function

[If the source and destination collection names are different](../../../server/ongoing-tasks/etl/raven#when-destination-collections-are-different)  
and deletions behavior is set to false,  
each document change will load a new document with an incremented document identity, thus saving a history.  

If the collection name of the destination is the same as the source, the ETL will simply update the destination document
without needing to change the ID.

<TabItem value="something" label="javascript">
<CodeBlock language="javascript">
{`function deleteDocumentsBehavior(docId, collection, deleted) \{
    // If any document in the specified source collection is modified but is not deleted,  
    // then the ETL will not send a delete command to the destination collection "Products".
    // (If collection names were different, the old document versions would remain 
    // and a new version would be stored with an incremented ID, thus saving a history of document versions.)
    if (collection === "Products" && deleted === false) 
        return false; 
    // If the source document was deleted, delete the entire set of versions from the destination.
    else return true;
\}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

## Deletions: Filtering deletions in the destination database

You can further specify the desired deletion behavior by adding filters.

By the time an ETL process runs a delete behavior function, the original document is already deleted from the source. 
It is no longer available. 
You may want the ETL to set up an archive of documents that were deleted from the source, 
or save a part of deleted documents in a separate document for later use.

Following are three examples of ways to save documents for later use when they are deleted from the source database:  

#### Filtering out all deletions:

<TabItem value="something" label="javascript">
<CodeBlock language="javascript">
{`loadToUsers(this);

function deleteDocumentsOfUsersBehavior(docId) \{
    return false;
\}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

#### Storing deletion info in an additional document:

When you delete a document you can store a deletion marker document that will prevent propagating the deletion by ETL.  

 * In the below example if the auxiliary document `LocalOnlyDeletions/{docId}` exists then we skip this deletion during ETL. 
   The auxiliary document can be created to protect certain documents from deletion in the destination database.
 * You can add `@expires` tag to the metadata when storing the marker document, so it would be automatically cleaned up after a certain time
   by [the expiration extension](../../../server/extensions/expiration#setting-the-document-expiration-time).
<TabItem value="something" label="javascript">
<CodeBlock language="javascript">
{`loadToUsers(this);

function deleteDocumentsOfUsersBehavior(docId) \{
    var localOnlyDeletion = load('LocalOnlyDeletions/' + docId);

    return !localOnlyDeletion;
\}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

#### When ETL is set on the entire database, but you want to filter deletions by certain collections:

If you define ETL for all documents, regardless of the collection they belong to, then the 
generic function can filter deletions by collection name.

<TabItem value="something" label="javascript">
<CodeBlock language="javascript">
{`function deleteDocumentsBehavior(docId, collection, deleted) \{
    return 'Users' != collection;
\}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| **docId** | `string` | The identifier of a deleted document. |
| **collection** | `string` | The name of a collection. |
| **deleted** | `bool` | Optional and therefore doesn't affect existing code. If you don't include the `deleted` parameter, RavenDB will execute the function without checking if the document was deleted from the source database. 
 If you include `deleted`, RavenDB will check if the document was indeed deleted or just updated.  If you set `return true` and the document was deleted in the source database, it will also delete the document in the destination database.  |

| Return | Description |
| - | - |
| **bool** | If the returned value is `true`, the document will be deleted. |


## Deletions Example: ETL script with deletion behavior defined

The following example will check if the source document was deleted or just updated before 
loading the transformed document. This function can be used if the destination collection is the same or different from the source.  

&gt; [In this example, the source and destination collection names are different](../../../server/ongoing-tasks/etl/raven#when-destination-collections-are-different) 
and deletions behavior is set to false if the source is deleted, 
so source deletions won't delete the destination document, thus saving a history of documents even if they're deleted in the source.  

&gt; If the source isn't deleted, the ETL process will delete the old version and load the new version with an incremented ID. 

Conversely, if you set it to `return false` every time a document is updated and not deleted, 
the destination will save a history of document versions 
with an incremented auto-generated ID for each version.

For this example, the fields `SupplierOrderLink` and `SupplierPhone` are added to test documents in the source database.  

<TabItem value="something" label="javascript">
<CodeBlock language="javascript">
{`// Define ETL to destination collection "productsHistory".
// Defined to update only the name of the item, a link to order the product, and the supplier's phone number
loadToproductsHistory (\{
    Name: this.Name + "updated data..",
    SupplierOrderLink: this.SupplierOrderLink + "updated data..",
    SupplierPhone: this.SupplierPhone + "updated data.."
\});

function deleteDocumentsBehavior(docId, collection, deleted) \{
    // Prevents document deletions from destination collection "productsHistory" if source document is deleted.
    if (collection === "productsHistory" && deleted === true)
        return false; 
    // If the source document information is updated (NOT deleted), 
    // and the source and destination collection names are different, like in this example, 
    // the script will delete then replace the destination document 
    // (with an incremented ID) to keep it current.
    if (collection === "productsHistory" && deleted === false)
        return true; 
\}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
