# Vector search: Start
<Admonition type="note" title="">

Vector search operations allow you to compare [Embeddings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedding_(machine_learning)) to find content by proximity rather than by exact matches, e.g. to find text by meaning or image by context.  
You can search over embeddings that were generated by RavenDB [ongoing embeddings-generation tasks](../../ai-integration/generating-embeddings/embeddings-generation-task) or by an external embeddings provider, or generate the embeddings for your documents on-the-fly while searching.  
- When you run a vector search, your search query is converted into an embedding as well, and can be compared against document embeddings using either a dynamic query for ad-hoc or infrequent searches or a static index for optimized performance.  
- Vector search can be used by other RavenDB AI features. For example, [GenAI tasks](../../ai-integration/gen-ai-integration/gen-ai_start) can use vector search to find documents and update them with LLM-generated content, or [AI agents](../../ai-integration/ai-agents/ai-agents_start) can use vector search to retrieve relevant data requested by the LLM.

## Use cases
Vector search can help wherever you need to find similar items based on proximity rather than exact matches, e.g. to compare texts by meaning or images by context. Here are a few examples.  

#### <u>Document & Knowledge Search</u>
* **Knowledge base search**  
  Find relevant documentation, policies, or procedures using natural language queries.
* **Legal document research**  
  Discover similar case law, contracts, or regulatory documents based on legal concepts.
* **Enterprise content management**  
  Search internal documents, reports, and communications by meaning rather than keywords.

#### <u>Product & Content Recommendation</u>
* **E-commerce product search**  
  Find products using descriptive queries like "comfortable winter running shoes".
* **Content recommendation systems**  
  Suggest similar articles, blog posts, videos, or media content.
* **Similar item discovery**  
  "Find items like this one" functionality for retail and content platforms.

#### <u>Customer Support Automation</u>
* **FAQ and help desk automation**  
  Route customer questions to the most relevant support articles or solutions.
* **Technical documentation search**  
  Find troubleshooting guides, API documentation, and how-to articles.
* **Chatbot knowledge retrieval**  
  Power AI assistants with contextually relevant information.

#### <u>Business Intelligence</u>
* **Customer profiling**  
  Find customers with similar behavior patterns, preferences, or demographics.
* **Fraud detection**  
  Identify transactions or behaviors similar to known fraudulent patterns.
* **Market research analysis**  
  Discover related trends, competitor insights, and industry reports.

#### <u>Media & Content Analysis</u>
* **Image similarity search**  
  Find visually or conceptually similar images, logos, or designs.
* **Content moderation**  
  Identify potentially problematic content based on similarity to flagged items.
* **Social media monitoring**  
  Track brand mentions and sentiment across platforms.
