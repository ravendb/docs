* After running the Setup Wizard and accepting the EULA as described in the [Overview](../../../start/installation/setup-wizard/overview.mdx),  
  the next step is to choose the **setup method** you want to proceed with.

The following setup methods are available:
    
![Choose setup method](./assets/choose-setup-method.png)
 
1. **Set up a new cluster**  
   Configure a new cluster (single-node or multi-node)  
   and start the **first RavenDB instance** on the machine where the Setup Wizard is running.  
   Learn more below in [Set up a new cluster](../../../start/installation/setup-wizard/choose-setup-method.mdx#set-up-a-new-cluster).  

2. **Create a package for external setup**    
   Prepare a configuration package without starting a server locally.  
   Learn more below in [Create a package for external setup](../../../start/installation/setup-wizard/choose-setup-method.mdx#create-a-package-for-external-setup).  

3. **Use an existing setup package**    
   Apply a previously generated setup package to join a node to a cluster.  
   Learn more below in [Use an existing setup package](../../../start/installation/setup-wizard/choose-setup-method.mdx#use-an-existing-setup-package).
    
4. Click **"Continue"** to proceed to the next step in the wizard, which is [Providing the license key](../../../start/installation/setup-wizard/provide-license-key.mdx).

<Panel heading="Set up a new cluster">

* Use this flow when you want to configure a new cluster (single-node or multi-node)    
  and start the **first RavenDB instance** on the machine where the Setup Wizard is running.    
  The wizard will guide you through the configuration process.  
    
* If you define a multi-node cluster, then at the end of this flow the wizard will generate a setup package (ZIP)  
  that you will use with the **Use setup package** method to add the remaining nodes.  

* The following table summarizes the step-by-step flow for this setup method.

<Panel heading="Use an existing setup package">

* Choose this flow when you already have a setup package (ZIP) created using one of the previous methods.  
  Use this method when:    
  * Setting up an additional node in an existing cluster.
  * Setting up a new cluster from a pre-configured package.        
    
* The Setup Wizard will apply the predefined configuration to the machine you run it on and add the node to the cluster.
    
* Repeat this process on each target machine to complete the cluster setup for each node in the cluster.
