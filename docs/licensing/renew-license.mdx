# Renew License
<Admonition type="note" title="">

* When your license expires, Studio is blocked.  
  Client API operations and other RavenDB features will continue to work.  
  However, any usage of expired RavenDB licenses is outside the license agreement and doesn't comply with the [EULA terms](https://ravendb.net/terms).  

* Renew your license as described below.  

* In this page:
   * [Renew commercial licenses](../licensing/renew-license.mdx#renew-commercial-licenses)
     * [Automatic renewal](../licensing/renew-license.mdx#automatic-renewal)
     * [Manual renewal](../licensing/renew-license.mdx#manual-renewal)
   * [Renew Developer & Community licenses](../licensing/renew-license#renew-developer-community-licenses)

<Panel heading="Renew commercial licenses">

This section relates to all commercial licenses: **Professional**, **Enterprise**, and all **ISV licenses**.  

<ContentFrame>

### Automatic renewal:  

These commercial licenses will be automatically renewed if:  
- Your server has an active connection to RavenDB's license server at `api.ravendb.net`,  
- **And** the [DisableAutoUpdate](../licensing/configuration.mdx#licensedisableautoupdate) configuration option is set to **false**.  

</ContentFrame>

<ContentFrame>

### Manual renewal:  

If the connection to RavenDB's [license server](../licensing/overview#manage-license-view) is unavailable, contact [customer service](https://ravendb.net/contact) to extend your license.  
A renewal email will be sent to you, with a new license that keeps your existing license ID.  
Copy the renewed license to the clipboard, and register it using either Studio or a configuration key, as you prefer.  

* To register your new license **using Studio**:  
  Follow the procedure described [here](../licensing/replace-license.mdx#replace-license-from-studio).

* To register your new license **using a configuration key**:  
   - Set the [DisableAutoUpdateFromApi](../licensing/configuration.mdx#licensedisableautoupdatefromapi) configuration option to **true**.
   - Activate the new license using a configuration key as described [here](../licensing/activate-license#activate-your-license-using-a-configuration-key).
   - Restart your server to make it read the set configuration key.

<Panel heading="Renew Developer & Community licenses">

* The **Developer** and **Community** licenses can be renewed from Studio.  
  The **Renew** button is available only for these license types.  

* Servers using a **Community** license are **required to run the latest major version**.  
  E.g., if RavenDB `7.0` is released and your server runs RavenDB `6.2` with a Community license, you will be required to upgrade RavenDB to version `7.0`.  
  Running a major version older than the latest with a Community license, will **block your server's access to Studio**.  
 
* **Developer** and **Community** licenses can be renewed when less than 30 days remain until expiration.
