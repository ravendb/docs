# RQL Code Assistance
<Admonition type="note" title="">

* All queries addressed to the RavenDB server use [RQL](../../querying/what-is-rql.mdx), 
  RavenDB's rich query language.  
* The **query structure** exposes the **order of the query operations** 
  handled by the RavenDB server when serving a query.  
* **RQL Code Assistance** is available when writing any query in the Studio.  
  The code auto-completion allows you to see the various paths your query 
  can take as data entities, functions, keywords, and operators are presented 
  for you to select, speeding up the writing process and making the creation 
  of intelligent queries an enjoyable task.  
* In addition, the query syntax is checked and potential errors are highlighted.  
* Code Assistance is available in the [Query](../../studio/database/queries/query-view.mdx#query-view), 
  [Patch](../../studio/database/documents/patch-view.mdx#patch-view), 
  and [Subscription Task Definition](../../studio/database/tasks/ongoing-tasks/subscription-task.mdx#subscription-task-definition) 
  views.  

* In this page:  
  * [Auto-Completion](../../studio/database/code-assistance.mdx#auto-completion)  
  * [Syntax Verification](../../studio/database/code-assistance.mdx#syntax-verification)  
</Admonition>
## Auto-Completion

* RQL code assistance is available in the following views:  
   - [Query View](../../studio/database/queries/query-view.mdx#query-view)  
   - [Patch View](../../studio/database/documents/patch-view.mdx#patch-view)  
   - [Subscription Task View](../../studio/database/tasks/ongoing-tasks/subscription-task.mdx#subscription-task-definition)  
* To invoke auto-completion, click **CTRL+Space** while writing RQL.  
* The relevant options for the current cursor location will be listed.  
* Clicking a list item will add it to the query.  
**At the very beginning of a query**, the suggested options will be the 
most basic ones:  

* [from](../../querying/what-is-rql.mdx#from) - to select a collection to query on  
* `from index` - to select an index to query on  
* [declare function](../../querying/what-is-rql.mdx#declare) - to create a JavaScript function

    * An Operator  
**As the query evolves**, new options that are are relevant to the current code are suggested.

### Syntax Verification

* As you write your query, its syntax is continuously verified and errors are detected.  
* When an error is detected, a warning sign is displayed on the left side of the editor.  
* Hovering over the warning sign shows the error details.
