# Session: How to customize key generation for entities?

In RavenDB you will encounter a few ways to create document keys. We suggest that you should first read up the article [Working with document identifiers](../../document-identifiers/working-with-document-ids.mdx)
to achieve the basic knowledge about built-in key generation strategies, before you start customizing identifiers of your entities.

In order to dive into key generation customizations you need to get familiar with conventions related to the identifiers. There are two dedicated articles that present
conventions which you can apply to all entity types or work more selectively and create a key generation customization for a particular type. Here are the relevant links:

* [Global key generation conventions](../../configuration/conventions/identifier-generation/global.mdx)
* [Type-specific key generation conventions](../../configuration/conventions/identifier-generation/type-specific.mdx)
