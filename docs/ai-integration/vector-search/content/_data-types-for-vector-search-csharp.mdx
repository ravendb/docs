* Data for vector search can be stored in **raw** or **pre-quantized** formats using several data types,  
  as outlined below.

* Text and numerical data that is not pre-quantized can be further quantized in the generated embeddings.  
  Learn more in [Quantization options](../../../ai-integration/vector-search/vector-search-using-dynamic-query.mdx#quantization-options).

## Supported data types for vector search

### Textual data

<Admonition type="note" title="">

`string` - A single text entry.  
`string[]` - An array of text entries.

</Admonition>
### Numerical data

* You can store **pre-generated** embedding vectors in your documents,  
  typically created by machine-learning models from text, images, or other sources.

* When storing numerical embeddings in a document field:  
  * Ensure that all vectors within this field across all documents in the collection are generated by the **same model** and model version and have the **same dimensions**.
  * Consistency in both dimensionality and model source is crucial for meaningful comparisons in the vector space.

* In addition to the native types described below, we highly recommended using [RavenVector](../../../ai-integration/vector-search/data-types-for-vector-search.mdx#ravenvector)  
  for efficient storage and fast queries when working with numerical embeddings.

<Admonition type="note" title="">

**Raw embedding data**:  
Use when precision is critical.  

`float[]` - A single vector of numerical values representing raw embedding data.  
`float[][]`- An array of vectors, where each entry is a separate embedding vector.  

</Admonition>
<Admonition type="note" title="">

**Pre-quantized data**:   
Use when you prioritize storage efficiency and query speed.  

`byte[] / sbyte[]` - A single pre-quantized embedding vector in the _Int8_ or _Binary_ quantization format.  
`byte[][] / sbyte[][]` - An array of pre-quantized embedding vectors.  

When storing data in these formats in your documents, you should use [RavenDBâ€™s vector quantizer methods](../../../ai-integration/vector-search/vector-search-using-dynamic-query.mdx#section-1).

</Admonition>
<Admonition type="note" title="">

**Base64-encoded data**:  
Use when embedding data needs to be represented as a compact and easily serializable string format.

`string` - A single vector encoded as a Base64 string.    
`string[]` - An array of Base64-encoded vectors.    

</Admonition>

**Using lists**:  

While arrays (`float[]`) are the most direct representation of numerical embeddings,  
you can also use lists (for example, `List<float>` or `List<float[]>`) for dynamic sizing in your application code.

## RavenVector

RavenVector is RavenDB's dedicated data type for storing and querying **numerical embeddings**.   
It is highly optimized to minimize storage space and improve the speed of reading arrays from disk,  
making it ideal for vector search.

For example, you can define:

<TabItem value="csharp" label="csharp">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`RavenVector<float>;       // A single vector of floating-point values.
List<RavenVector<float>>; // A collection of float-based vectors.
RavenVector<sbyte>;       // A single pre-quantized vector in Int8 format (8-bit signed integer).
List<RavenVector<sbyte>>; // A collection of sbyte-based vectors.
RavenVector<byte>;        // A single pre-quantized vector in Binary format (8-bit unsigned integer).
List<RavenVector<byte>>;  // A collection of byte-based vectors.
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
When a class property is stored as a `RavenVector`, the vector's content will appear under the `@vector` field in the JSON document stored in the database.
For example:

<Tabs groupId='languageSyntax'>
<TabItem value="CSharp_class" label="CSharp_class">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`public class SampleClass
{
    public string Id { get; set; }
    public string Title { get; set; }
    
    // Storing data in a RavenVector property for optimized storage and performance
    public RavenVector<float> EmbeddingRavenVector { get; set; }
    
    // Storing data in a regular array property
    public float[] EmbeddingVector { get; set; }
}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
