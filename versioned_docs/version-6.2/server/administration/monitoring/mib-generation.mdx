# Monitoring: MIB generation and usage
<Admonition type="note" title="">

* RavenDB allows you to generate a MIB (Management Information Base) file that contains 
  a structured collection of SNMP OIDs.  

* The MIB can be generated through RavenDB's `/monitoring/snmp/mib` endpoint, 
  and fine-tuned using flags.  

* The created MIB can be used by monitoring tools to extract RavenDB metrics via SNMP.  

* In this page:

## Generating a MIB

### MIB generation endpoint

To generate a MIB, use RavenDB's HTTP `/monitoring/snmp/mib` GET endpoint.  
You can inspect this endpoint using your browser to download a text file with 
RavenDB's OIDs, or connect it with a monitoring tool to utilize these OIDs.  

To use the endpoint, add its path to RavenDB's address (including RavenDB's port number).  

- To generate a MIB for RavenDB's live test server, for example. use:  
  [http://live-test.ravendb.net/monitoring/snmp/mib](http://live-test.ravendb.net/monitoring/snmp/mib)  
### Fine-tune the OIDs list

By default, the generated MIB includes **server** metrics OIDs. You can fine-tune 
it to include the OIDs range your are interested in. Available options are:  

* `includeServer` - Include or exclude OIDs with **server** metrics.  
* `includeCluster` - Include or exclude OIDs with **cluster** metrics.  
* `includeDatabases` - Include or exclude OIDs with **databases** metrics.  

#### Examples:
To include **databases** metrics OIDs, for example, you can use the `includeDatabases` flag this way:  
[http://live-test.ravendb.net/monitoring/snmp/mib?includeDatabases=true](http://live-test.ravendb.net/monitoring/snmp/mib?includeDatabases=true)  
Or to exclude **server** metrics OIDs use the **includeServer** flag like so:  
[http://live-test.ravendb.net/monitoring/snmp/mib?includeServer=false](http://live-test.ravendb.net/monitoring/snmp/mib?includeServer=false)
