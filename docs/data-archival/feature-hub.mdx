# Data Archival: Feature Hub / Start


## Overview

Data Archival in RavenDB lets you keep documents long-term without slowing down your active database.  
By adding an `@archive-at` timestamp to a documentâ€™s metadata, you can tell RavenDB when to move it into an archived state.  
Archived documents are compressed, excluded from indexes and subscriptions by default, but still fully retrievable and can be unarchived at any time.
This keeps indexes small, improves performance, and reduces storage costs while preserving history.

## Use cases

A company maintains an Orders collection with millions of records, but only needs to search and process orders from the last 6 months. 
Older orders must remain available for audits and customer service. 
By enabling archiving older orders, RavenDB automatically compresses and excludes them from indexing and subscriptions. 
The team gets faster queries and smaller indexes, while still being able to load any archived order if needed.
