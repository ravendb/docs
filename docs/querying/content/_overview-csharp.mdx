* Queries in RavenDB can be written with either of the following:
    * **LINQ** - when querying with the session's `Query` method.  
    * **Low-level API** - when querying with the session's `DocumentQuery` method.  
    * **RQL**:  
        * when querying with the session's `RawQuery` method.  
        * when querying from the [Query view](../../studio/database/queries/query-view.mdx) in Studio.  

* Queries defined with `Query` or `DocumentQuery` are translated by the RavenDB client to [RQL](../../querying/rql/what-is-rql.mdx)  
  when sent to the server.
    
* All queries in RavenDB use an **index** to provide results, even when you don't specify one.  
  Learn more [below](../../querying/overview.mdx#queries-always-provide-results-using-an-index).

* Queries that do Not specify which index to use are called **Dynamic Queries**.  
  This article displays examples of dynamic queries only.  
  For examples showing how to query an index see [querying an index](../../indexes/querying/query-index.mdx).
    
* The entities returned by the query are 'loaded' and **tracked** by the [Session](../../client-api/session/what-is-a-session-and-how-does-it-work.mdx).  
  Entities will Not be tracked when:  
    * Query returns a [projection](../../client-api/session/querying/how-to-project-query-results.mdx)  
    * Tracking is [disabled](../../client-api/session/configuration/how-to-disable-tracking.mdx#disable-tracking-query-results)  

* Query results are **cached** by default. To disable query caching see [NoCaching](../../client-api/session/querying/how-to-customize-query.mdx#nocaching).

* Queries are timed out after a configurable time period.  See [query timeout](../../server/configuration/database-configuration.mdx#databasesquerytimeoutinsec).

<Panel heading="Queries always provide results using an index">

* Queries always use an index to provide fast results regardless of the size of your data.  

* When a query reaches a RavenDB instance, the instance calls its query optimizer to analyze the query  
  and determine which index should be used to retrieve the requested data.
 
* Indexes allow to provide query results without scanning the entire dataset each and every time.  
  * Learn more about indexes, their general concept, and the different **index types** in this [indexes overview](../../studio/database/indexes/indexes-overview.mdx) article.
  * You can choose the underlying **search engine** that will be used by the RavenDB indexes.  
    Learn more in [selecting the search engine](../../indexes/search-engine/corax.mdx#selecting-the-search-engine).

<Admonition type="info" title="">

We differentiate between the following **3 query scenarios**:  

   1. [Index query](../../querying/overview.mdx#indexquery)  
   2. [Dynamic query](../../querying/overview.mdx#dynamicquery)  
   3. [Full collection query](../../querying/overview.mdx#collectionquery)

For each scenario, a different index type is used, as described below.

</Admonition>
<Admonition type="note" title="">

<a id="indexQuery"/> 
**1. Query an existing index**:

*  **Query type**: Index query  
   **Index used**: Static-index  

* You can specify which **STATIC-index** the query will use.

* Static indexes are defined by the user, as opposed to auto-indexes that are created by the server  
  when querying a collection with some filtering applied. See [Static-index vs Auto-index](../../studio/database/indexes/indexes-overview.mdx#auto-indexes--vs--static-indexes).  

* Example RQL: &nbsp; `from index "Employees/ByFirstName" where FirstName == "Laura"`  
  See more examples in [querying an index](../../indexes/querying/query-index.mdx).

</Admonition>
<Admonition type="note" title="">

<a id="dynamicQuery"/> 
**2. Query a collection - with filtering**:  

*  **Query type**: Dynamic Query  
   **Index used**: Auto-index  

* When querying a collection without specifying an index and with some filtering condition  
  (other than just the document ID) the query-optimizer will analyze the query to see if an **AUTO-index**  
  that can answer the query already exists, i.e. an auto-index on the collection queried with index-fields that match those queried.  

* If such auto-index (Not a static one...) is found, it will be used to fetch the results.  

* Else, if no relevant auto-index is found,  
  the query-optimizer will create a new auto-index with fields that match the query criteria.  
  At this time, and only at this time, the query will wait for the auto-indexing process to complete.  
  Subsequent queries that target this auto-index will be served immediately.  

* Note: if there exists an auto-index that is defined on the collection queried  
  but is indexing a different field than the one queried on,  
  then the query-optimizer will create a new auto-index that merges both the  
  fields from the existing auto-index and the new fields queried.

* Once the newly created auto-index is done indexing the data,  
  the old auto-index is removed in favor of the new one.

* Over time, an optimal set of indexes is generated by the query optimizer to answer your queries.

* Example RQL: &nbsp; `from Employees where FirstName == "Laura"`  
  See more examples [below](../../querying/overview.mdx#session-query).
* Note: Counters and Time series are an exception to this flow.  
  Dynamic queries on counters and time series values don't create auto-indexes.  
  However, a static-index can be defined on [Time series](../../document-extensions/timeseries/indexing.mdx) and [Counters](../../document-extensions/counters/indexing.mdx).

</Admonition>
<Admonition type="note" title="">

<a id="collectionQuery"/> 
**3. Query a collection - query full collection | query by ID**:  
 
* **Query type**: Full collection Query  
  **Index used**: The raw collection (internal storage indexes)  

* Full collection query:

  * When querying a collection without specifying an index and with no filtering condition,  
    then all documents from the specified collection are returned.

  * RavenDB uses the raw collection documents in its **internal storage indexes** as the source for this query.  
    No auto-index is created.
   
  * Example RQL: &nbsp; `from Employees`

* Query by document ID:
 
  * When querying a collection only by document ID or IDs,  
    then similar to the full collection query, no auto-index is created.  
  
  * RavenDB uses the raw collection documents as the source for this query.  

  * Example RQL: &nbsp; `from Employees where id() == "employees/1-A"`  
    See more examples [below](../../querying/overview.mdx#session-query).

</Admonition>

</Panel>

<Panel heading="Session.Query">

* The simplest way to issue a query is by using the session's `Query` method which supports LINQ.  
  Both the LINQ method syntax and the LINQ query syntax are supported.  

* The following examples show **dynamic queries** that do not specify which index to use.  
  Please refer to [querying an index](../../indexes/querying/query-index.mdx) for other examples.

* Querying can be enhanced using these [extension methods](../../querying/overview.mdx#custom-methods-and-extensions-for-linq).
