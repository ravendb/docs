# Data Archival

### Archive your documents for long-term storage without impacting performance.

RavenDB’s Data Archival feature is ideal when you need to keep historical documents without including them in active queries, indexes, or subscriptions.
Archiving lets you retain documents for as long as needed without bloating indexes or slowing queries.
Simply add an `@archive-at` timestamp to a document’s metadata to tell RavenDB when to archive it.

Once archived:  
* Documents are compressed.
* Excluded from indexes and subscriptions by default.
* Still fully retrievable and can be unarchived anytime.

This keeps your active dataset lean while preserving historical data.

### Use cases

A company maintains an Orders collection with millions of records, but only needs to search and process orders from the last 6 months.
Older orders must remain available for audits and customer service.
By enabling data archiving, RavenDB automatically compresses and excludes older orders from indexing and subscriptions.
The team gets faster queries, smaller indexes, and lower storage costs - while still being able to load any archived order when needed.
