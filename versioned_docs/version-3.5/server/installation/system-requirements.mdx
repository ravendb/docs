# Installation: System requirements

## Server mode

### Minimum requirements

* 2 GB of RAM
* 1 GHz Dual core
* 1 GB of disk space
* 64 bit OS
* .NET 4.5

### Recommended requirements

* 4 GB of RAM (the more, the better)
* 2 GHz Quad core (the more, the better)
* 50 GB of disk space (the more, the better)
* Note that splitting the db across multiple physical HDs is also recommended
* 64 bit OS
* .NET 4.5 (or higher)

## Embedded mode

### Minimum requirements

* 512 MB of RAM
* Pentium III-class, 700MHz
* 150 MB of disk space
* 32 bit OS
* .NET 4.5 (or higher)

Those are the _absolute minimum requirements_ for it to run. Please note that this is strictly for embedded mode, usually for dedicated devices such as Point of Sales systems where the amount of data and the number of queries are known in advance and the system has been configured specifically to allow that.
