{PANEL: The Document View}

![Figure 1. Document View](images/document-view-1.png "Document: 'Suppliers/1-A' in the 'Suppliers' Collection")

1. **Document identifier (ID)**  
   * For detailed explanation about the possible identifiers See [Create New Document](../../../../todo-update-me-later)  
   * Clicking the link, right by the ID, will show the _raw document output_ that is received  from the server  
<br/>
2. **Document properties**  
   * **Change-Vector**  
     * The _change-vector_ uniquely marks the specific version of the document globally in the cluster  
     * Each time a document is modified, a new _change-vector_ is generated  
     * Used for optimistic  concurrency control, various internal operations and caching  
     * It is composed of a list of node _tags_ and _etags_  
       _Node tag_ - uniquely identifies a node  
       _etag_ - a 64 bit number that is incremented on every operation in a database  
   * **Modified** - The last time the document was modified by any client, or by the Studio  
   * **Size** - The Document size (including attachments)  
<br/>
3. **Document content** - The document properties and values in JSON format  
   * a. **Nested Data**  
        * Another JSON object can be nested in a property value  
<br/>
   * b. **Referenced Documents**  
        * Your can reference other documents from any other collection (or from the current collection)  
        * These referenced documents can then be _included_ in a single _Load_ request to the server. See [Load with Includes](../../../client-api/session/loading-entities#load-with-includes)  
        * e.g., In the example above, _'categories/1-A'_ document is referenced in the _'Category'_ property  
<br/>
   * c. **Metadata**  
        * This is additional information about the document  
        * The metadata, also in JSON format, is embedded inside the document and is an integral part of it  
        * RavenDB server reserves metadata properties that start with _'@'_ for its own use  
        * You can add properties to the metadata and use to store your own values  
        * Note: only the following metadata properties will show in the Studio:  
           * ***@collection*** - determines to which collection the document belongs to  
           * ***@flags*** - i.e. if a document has attachments, revisions, etc.  
           * ***Custom metadata*** properties - any metadata properties generated in code by a client  
<br/>

4. **Related Document**  
   * List of related documents - those are the documents that are _referenced_ inside the document. (see 3b above)
   * Click to open each
