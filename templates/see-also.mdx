# See also

The `SeeAlso` component is used to display a list of related articles or external resources at the end of a page. It is automatically rendered in the page footer when the `see_also` property is defined in the page's frontmatter.

## Usage

To add a "See also" section to your page, add the `see_also` key to your MDX frontmatter:

```mdx
---
title: "Your Page Title"
see_also:
    - title: "Introduction to Cloud API"
      link: "/api/introduction"
      source: "docs"
      path: "Cloud API > Basics"
    - title: "How to set up SSO"
      link: "/guides/sso-setup"
      source: "guides"
      path: "Security > Authentication"
    - title: "Website"
      link: "https://web.site"
      source: "external"
      path: "External > Corporate"
---
```

### Frontmatter Fields

| Field    | Type     | Description                                                                                                                     |
| :------- | :------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `title`  | `string` | The title of the related article.                                                                                               |
| `link`   | `string` | The URL or internal path. For `docs`, it's automatically versioned.                                                             |
| `source` | `Enum`   | Icons are assigned based on the source: `docs`, `cloud`, `guides`, or `external`.                                               |
| `path`   | `string` | Breadcrumb-style path (e.g., `Category > Subcategory`). The first part is shown by default, and the full path appears on hover. |

## Features

### 1. Automatic Icons

The component automatically selects an icon based on the `source` property:

- `docs`: Document icon
- `cloud`: Cloud icon
- `guides`: Guides icon
- `external`: External link icon

### 2. Versioned Documentation Links

For items with `source: "docs"`, the component automatically prepends the current documentation version to the `link`.

- If you are on version `7.1` of the docs, a link like `/api/basics` becomes `/7.1/api/basics`.
- If the link already starts with a version (e.g., `/8.0/api/basics`), it is used as is.

### 3. Progressive Path Display

The `path` property uses the `>` separator to define a hierarchy.

- Only the **first part** of the path (the main category) is displayed initially.
- The **full path** is revealed when the user hovers over the item.

    When using frontmatter, you do not need to import the `SeeAlso` component or add it to the body of your MDX. The `DocItemFooter` theme component handles rendering it automatically if the frontmatter exists.
