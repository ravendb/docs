# GenAI tasks

### Build intelligent workflows with GenAI tasks.
GenAI tasks are [ongoing operations](../../studio/database/tasks/ongoing-tasks/general-info) that continuously monitor specified collections and process documents as they are added or modified.  
- Similar to [ETL tasks](../../studio/database/tasks/ongoing-tasks/ravendb-etl-task), a GenAI task extracts content from documents. But instead of sending the content to another database, the task sends it to an AI model (like OpenAI) along with a guiding **prompt** and a **JSON schema** that defines the layout for the model's response.  
- When the LLM responds, the GenAI task can use its response to, for example, update the source document with LLM-generated content, or create new documents in the database.  
- GenAI tasks can infuse intelligence into a wide variety of content handling scenarios.  
  E.g., they can enrich documents with AI-generated summaries or classifications, translate text into different languages, or generate new content based on existing data.
- You can easily create GenAI tasks using Studio or the client API.  
  When created via Studio, each step of their creation can be easily tested and validated before deployment.  

### Use cases
GenAI tasks can infuse intelligence into a wide variety of content handling scenarios. Here are some of the categories in which they can help.
* Data enrichment & enhancement
* Smart automation & workflows
* Enhanced search & discovery
* Business intelligence & insights
* Content analysis & moderation
