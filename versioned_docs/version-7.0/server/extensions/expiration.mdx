* Documents can be given a future expiration time in which they'll be automatically deleted.  
* The Expiration feature deletes documents set for expiration, when their time has passed.  
* You can enable or disable the expiration feature while the database is already live with data.

## Expiration feature usages

Use the Expiration feature when data is needed only for a given time period.  
E.g., for -  

 * Shopping cart data that is kept only for a certain time period  
 * Email links that need to be expired after a few hours  
 * A web application login session details  
 * Cache data from an SQL server  



## Configuring the expiration feature

Documents expiration settings can be changed via Studio or the API.  
It is possible to:  

* Enable or Disable the deletion of expired documents.  
  Default value: **Disable** the deletion of expired documents.  
* Determine how often RavenDB would look for expired documents and delete them.  
  Default value: **60 seconds**  
* Set the maximal number of documents that RavenDB is allowed to delete per interval.  
  Default value: **All expired documents**

</Admonition>
### Configure expiration settings using the client API  

Modify the expiration settings using the client API by setting an `ExpirationConfiguration` 
object and sending it to RavenDB using a `ConfigureExpirationOperation` operation.  

#### Example:

<TabItem value="configuration" label="configuration">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`await store.Maintenance.SendAsync(new ConfigureExpirationOperation(new ExpirationConfiguration
\{
    Disabled = false,
    DeleteFrequencyInSec = 60,
    MaxItemsToProcess = 1000
\}));
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

#### `ExpirationConfiguration`

<TabItem value="expirationConfiguration" label="expirationConfiguration">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`public class ExpirationConfiguration
\{
    // Set 'Disabled' to false to enable the deletion of expired items                    
    public bool Disabled \{ get; set; \}

    // How frequently to delete expired items
    public long? DeleteFrequencyInSec \{ get; set; \}

    // How many items to delete (per batch)
    public long? MaxItemsToProcess \{ get; set; \}
\}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| **Disabled** | `bool` | If `true`, deleting expired documents is disabled for the entire database.&lt;BR&gt;Default: `true` |
| **DeleteFrequencyInSec** | `long?` | Determines how often (in seconds) the expiration feature looks for expired documents and deletes them.&lt;BR&gt;Default: `60` |
| **MaxItemsToProcess** | `long?` | Determines the maximal number of documents the feature is allowed to delete in one run. |



## Setting the document expiration time

* To set a document expiration time, add the document's `@metadata` an 
  `@expires` property with the designated expiration time as a value.  
  Set the time in **UTC** format, not local time. E.g. -  
  **"@expires": "2025-04-22T08:00:00.0000000Z"**  
  <Admonition type="warning" title="Warning">
  Metadata properties starting with `@` are for internal RavenDB usage only.  
  Do _not_ use the metadata `@expires` property for any other purpose than 
  scheduling a document's expiration time for the built-in expiration feature.  
  </Admonition>
* If and when the expiration feature is enabled, it will process all documents 
  carrying the `@expires` flag and automatically delete each document 
  [by its expiration time](../../server/extensions/expiration.mdx#eventual-consistency-considerations).  
* To set the document expiration time from the client, use the following code:
<TabItem value="expiration1" label="expiration1">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`DateTime expiry = DateTime.UtcNow.AddMinutes(5);
using (IAsyncDocumentSession session = store.OpenAsyncSession())
\{
    await session.StoreAsync(user);
    session.Advanced.GetMetadataFor(user)[Constants.Documents.Metadata.Expires] = expiry;
    await session.SaveChangesAsync();
\}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>



## Eventual consistency considerations

* Internally, RavenDB tracks all documents carrying the `@expires` flag even if the 
  expiration feature is disabled. This way, once the expiration feature is enabled expired 
  documents can be processed without delay.  
* Once a document expires, it may take up to the _delete frequency interval_ (60 seconds by default) 
  until is it actually deleted.  
* Deletion may be further delayed if `MaxItemsToProcess` is set, limiting the number 
  of documents that RavenDB is allowed to delete each time the expiration feature is invoked.  
* Expired documents are _not_ filtered out during `load`, `query`, or indexing, so be aware that 
  as long as an expired document hasn't been actually deleted it may still be included in the results.
