**Patch** command is used to perform partial document updates without having to load, modify, and save a full document. This is usually useful for updating denormalized data in entities.

Patching is performed using [bulk_docs endpoint](../../../../client-api/commands/batches/how-to-send-multiple-commands-using-a-batch.mdx) with [ScriptedPatchCommandData](../../../../glossary/scripted-patch-command-data.mdx) as payload.
