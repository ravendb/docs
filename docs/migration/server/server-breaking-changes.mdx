# Migration: Server breaking changes

* The features listed on this page were available in former RavenDB versions.  
  In RavenDB `7.2.x`, they are either unavailable or their behavior is inconsistent with their behavior in previous versions.  

* Find breaking changes for previous RavenDB versions [here](../../migration/server/previous-versions-server-breaking-changes).

   * [Elasticsearch .NET client library version change](../../migration/server/server-breaking-changes.mdx#elasticsearch-net-client-library-version-change)

<Panel heading="Elasticsearch .NET client library version change">

- RavenDB `6.2`, `7.0`, and `7.1` use `Elastic.Clients.Elasticsearch 8.x`, enabling RavenDB to use Elasticsearch server `8.x` and `9.x`.  
- Starting with version `7.2`, RavenDB uses `Elastic.Clients.Elasticsearch 9.x`, compatible with Elasticsearch server `9.x` and `10.x`.  

If you use ETL to send data from [RavenDB to Elasticsearch](../../server/ongoing-tasks/etl/elasticsearch), please make sure that the RavenDB and Elasticsearch servers you use are compatible to prevent any transfer issues.

[See Elasticsearch compatibility table](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-net?tab=readme-ov-file#compatibility)
