# UniqueConstraints Bundle

## Premise

This bundle aims to allow the user to implement unique constraints in the objects (useful for properties like email or social security number).

## How it works

The bundle works both in the server (using a PutTrigger and a DeleteTrigger) and in the client (using a DocumentStoreListener and providing extension methods on IDocumentSession).

When a document is stored in the database it generates "dummy" documents with the fields as "UniqueConstraints/" + entityName + "/" + propertyName + "/" + propertyValue. This way you don't require indexes (which would need to be stale to check for uniqueness).

### UniqueConstraintsStoreListener

The listener works by using reflection when the document is stored on the database and generating metadata regarding it's unique constraints. The reflection result is cached in a ConcurrentDictionary to help with performance.

### UniqueConstraintSessionExtensions

The bundle provides two extension methods for IDocumentSession.

#### LoadByUniqueConstraint

Allows to load a document by it's UniqueConstraint, returning null if the document doesn't exists.

#### CheckForUniqueConstraints

Checks a document to see if it's constraints are available in the server. It returns a UniqueConstraintCheckResult containing the loaded docs and what property they are responsible for.


### UniqueConstraintsPutTrigger

The put trigger acts whenever it finds a document being inserted with constraints metadata. It checks for existing documents in the constraints. If any existing document is found, it returns a VetoResult.Deny informing the conflicting fields. This would need to be checked on the client-side using a try block for the OperationVetoedException.

If a document is being updated the trigger updates the generated constraint document.

### UniqueConstraintsDeleteTrigger

The delete trigger acts whenever it find a document being delete with constraints metadata and deletes the referenced constraint documents.

## Usage

### Server side

Drop the Raven.Bundles.UniqueContraints assembly in the Plugins directory.

### Client side

When creating the DocumentStore, you'll need to register the UniqueConstraintsStoreListener in the store, like this:

    store.RegisterListener(new UniqueConstraintsStoreListener());

### Extension methods

To use the extension methods add using to

    using Raven.Client.UniqueConstraints;

To check if a value is available use:

	var existingUser = session.LoadByUniqueConstraint&lt;User&gt;(x =&gt; x.Email, "john@gmail.com");

To check a document against the database and use:

	
```
var user = new User() { Name = "John", Email = "john@gmail.com" };
	var checkResult = session.CheckForUniqueConstraints(user);

	// returns whether it's constraints are available
	if ( checkResult.ConstraintsAreFree() ) {
		session.Store(user);
	} else {
		var existingUser = checkResult.DocumentForProperty(x =&gt; x.Email);
	}
```
