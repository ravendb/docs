## Multi-account configuration

It is possible to become the owner of multiple *Cloud Accounts* using the same email address.  
This can be useful if you need to separate environments, teams, or billing contexts.   
However, creating multiple Cloud Accounts under one email is not available through the self-service UI. 

To set this up, please contact *RavenDB Cloud Support* and request a multi-account configuration.
