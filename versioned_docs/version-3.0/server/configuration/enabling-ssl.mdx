# Configuration: Enabling SSL

<Admonition type="info" title="">
SSL can only be enabled when RavenDB is running as a Windows Service. The certificate has to be installed in the local certificate repository [Certificates - Local Computer\Personal\Certificates] and include the private key (.pfx file), otherwise the following will not work.
</Admonition>

By default, secure connectivity is disabled. To enable the SSL in RavenDB, you need to do the following:

1. change `Raven/UseSsl` configuration to `true`.  
2. tell RavenDB to use the specified X509 certificate. 

To tell RavenDB to use the specified X509 certificate, execute the following command on the command line:   

<TabItem value="plain" label="plain">
<CodeBlock language="plain">
{`Raven.Server.exe /installSSL=PathToCertificate==CertificatePassword
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

E.g.   
<TabItem value="plain" label="plain">
<CodeBlock language="plain">
{`Raven.Server.exe /installSSL=C:\\Temp\\MyCertificate.pfx==MyPassword
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

To uninstall the certificate execute:    

<TabItem value="plain" label="plain">
<CodeBlock language="plain">
{`Raven.Server.exe /uninstallSSL=PathToCertificate==CertificatePassword
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

<Admonition type="note" title="">
The Studio might not work in some browsers (e.g. Firefox and Chrome) if the domain that certificate was issued for does not match the domain you are using it for.
</Admonition>   

## Ignoring SSL errors

In RavenDB, we have added an option to ignore all SSL certificate validation errors. By default, `Raven/IgnoreSslCertificateErrors` configuration option is set to **None**, but it can be changed if needed.

<Admonition type="danger" title="">
We do not recommend setting `Raven/IgnoreSslCertificateErrors` to **All** due to safety reasons. Enabling this option is done at your own risk.
</Admonition>
