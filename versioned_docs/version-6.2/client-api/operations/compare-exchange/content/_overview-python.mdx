* Compare Exchange items are **key/value pairs** where the key is unique across your database. 

* Compare-exchange operations require cluster consensus to ensure consistency across all nodes.  
  Once a consensus is reached, the compare-exchange items are distributed through the Raft algorithm to all nodes in the database group.

* Compare-exchange items can be used to coordinate work between sessions that are trying to modify a shared resource (such as a document) at the same time.

* Compare-exchange items are [not replicated externally](../../../../client-api/operations/compare-exchange/overview.mdx#why-compare-exchange-items-are-not-replicated-to-external-databases) to other databases.

## What Compare Exchange Items Are

Compare Exchange items are key/value pairs where the key servers a unique value across your database.

* Each compare-exchange item contains: 
  * **A key** - A unique string identifier in the database scope.
  * **A value** - Can be any object (a number, string, array, or any valid JSON object). 
  * **Metadata** - Data that is associated with the compare-exchange item.
    Must be a valid JSON object.
     * For example, the metadata can be used to set expiration time for the compare-exchange item.  
       Learn more in [compare-exchange expiration](../../../../client-api/operations/compare-exchange/compare-exchange-expiration.mdx).  
  * **Raft index** - The compare-exchange item's version.  
    Any change to the value or metadata will increase this number.  

* Creating and modifying a compare-exchange item is an atomic, thread-safe [compare-and-swap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compare-and-swap) interlocked 
  compare-exchange operation.



## Creating and Managing Compare-Exchange Items
  
Compare exchange items are created and managed with any of the following approaches:

* **Document Store Operations**  
  You can manage a compare-exchange item as an [Operation on the document store](../../../../client-api/operations/compare-exchange/put-compare-exchange-value.mdx).  
  This can be done within or outside of a session (cluster-wide or single-node session).
   * When inside a session:  
     If the session fails, the compare-exchange operation can still succeed
     because store Operations do not rely on the success of the session.  
     You will need to delete the compare-exchange item explicitly upon session failure if you don't want the compare-exchange item to persist.

* **Cluster-Wide Sessions**  
  You can manage a compare-exchange item from inside a [Cluster-Wide session](../../../../client-api/session/cluster-transaction/compare-exchange.mdx).  
  If the session fails, the compare-exchange item creation also fails.  
  None of the nodes in the group will have the new compare-exchange item.


* **Atomic Guards**  
  When creating documents using a cluster-wide session RavenDB automatically creates [Atomic Guards](../../../../client-api/session/cluster-transaction/atomic-guards.mdx),  
  which are compare-exchange items that guarantee ACID transactions.  
  See [Cluster-wide vs. Single-node](../../../../client-api/session/cluster-transaction/overview.mdx#cluster-wide-transaction-vs-single-node-transaction) for a session comparision overview.

* **Studio**  
  Compare-exchange items can be created from the [Studio](../../../../studio/database/documents/compare-exchange-view.mdx#the-compare-exchange-view) as well.



## Why Compare-Exchange Items are Not Replicated to External Databases 

* Each cluster defines its policies and configurations, and should ideally have sole responsibility for managing its own documents. 
  Read [Consistency in a Globally Distributed System](https://ayende.com/blog/196769-B/data-ownership-in-a-distributed-system) 
  to learn more about why global database modeling is more efficient this way.
   
* When creating a compare-exchange item a Raft consensus is required from the nodes in the database group.
  Externally replicating such data is problematic as the target database may reside within a cluster that is in an
  unstable state where Raft decisions cannot be made. In such a state, the compare-exchange item will not be persisted in the target database.

* Conflicts between documents that occur between two databases are solved with the help of the documents
  Change-Vector. Compare-exchange conflicts cannot be handled properly as they do not have a similar
  mechanism to resolve conflicts.

* To ensure unique values between two databases without using compare-exchange items see [Example III](../../../../client-api/operations/compare-exchange/overview.mdx#example-iii---ensuring-unique-values-without-using-compare-exchange).



## Example I - Email Address Reservation  

The following example shows how to use compare-exchange to create documents with unique values.  
The scope is within the database group on a single cluster. 

Compare-exchange items are not externally replicated to other databases.  
To establish uniqueness without using compare-exchange see [Example III](../../../../client-api/operations/compare-exchange/overview.mdx#example-iii---ensuring-unique-values-without-using-compare-exchange).

<TabItem value="email" label="email">
<CodeBlock language="python">
{`email = "user@example.com"

user = User(email=email)

with store.open_session() as sesion:
    sesion.store(user)
    # At this point, the user document has an Id assigned

    # Try to reserve a new user email
    # Note: This operation takes place outside the session transaction,
    # It is a cluster-wide reservation
    cmp_xchg_result = store.operations.send(PutCompareExchangeValueOperation(f"emails/\{email\}", user.Id, 0))

    if cmp_xchg_result.successful is False:
        raise RuntimeError("Email is already in use")

    # At this point we managed to reserve/save the user mail -
    # The document can be saved in save_changes
    sesion.save_changes()
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>  

**Implications**:

* The `User` object is saved as a document, hence it can be indexed, queried, etc.  

* This compare-exchange item was [created as an operation](../../../../client-api/operations/compare-exchange/put-compare-exchange-value.mdx)
  rather than with a [cluster-wide session](../../../../client-api/session/cluster-transaction/overview.mdx).  
  Thus, if `session.save_changes` fails, then the email reservation is _not_ rolled back automatically.  
  It is your responsibility to do so.  

* The compare-exchange value that was saved can be accessed in a query using `CmpXchg`:  
<Tabs groupId='languageSyntax'>
<TabItem value="Query" label="Query">
<CodeBlock language="python">
{`query = sesion.query(object_type=User).where_equals("Id", CmpXchg.value("emails/ayende@ayende.com"))
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>  
<TabItem value="RQL" label="RQL">
<CodeBlock language="sql">
{`from Users as s where id() == cmpxchg("emails/ayende@ayende.com")
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
    </Tabs>
    

## Example II - Reserve a Shared Resource  

In the following example, we use compare-exchange to reserve a shared resource.  
The scope is within the database group on a single cluster.

The code also checks for clients which never release resources (i.e. due to failure) by using timeout.  

<TabItem value="shared_resource" label="shared_resource">
<CodeBlock language="python">
{`class SharedResource:
    def __init__(self, reserved_until: datetime = None):
        self.reserved_until = reserved_until

def print_work() -> None:
    # Try to get hold of the printer resource
    reservation_index = lock_resource(store, "Printer/First-Floor", timedelta(minutes=20))

    try:
        ...
        # Do some work for the duration that was set
        # Don't exceed the duration, otherwise resource is available for someone else
    finally:
        release_resource(store, "Printer/First-Floor", reservation_index)

def lock_resource(document_store: DocumentStore, resource_name: str, duration: timedelta):
    while True:
        now = datetime.utcnow()

        resource = SharedResource(reserved_until=now + duration)
        save_result = document_store.operations.send(
            PutCompareExchangeValueOperation(resource_name, resource, 0)
        )

        if save_result.successful:
            # resource_name wasn't present - we managed to reserve
            return save_result.index

        # At this point, Put operation failed - someone else owns the lock or lock time expired
        if save_result.value.reserved_until < now:
            # Time expired - Update the existing key with new value
            take_lock_with_timeout_result = document_store.operations.send(
                PutCompareExchangeValueOperation(resource_name, resource, save_result.index)
            )

            if take_lock_with_timeout_result.successful:
                return take_lock_with_timeout_result.index

        # Wait a little bit and retry
        time.sleep(0.02)

def release_resource(store: DocumentStore, resource_name: str, index: int) -> None:
    delete_result = store.operations.send(DeleteCompareExchangeValueOperation(resource_name, index))

    # We have 2 options here:
    # delete_result.successful is True - we managed to release resource
    # delete_result.successful is False - someone else took the lock due to timeout
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>



## Example III - Ensuring Unique Values without Using Compare Exchange  

Unique values can also be ensured without using compare-exchange.

The below example shows how to achieve that by using **reference documents**.  
The reference documents' IDs will contain the unique values instead of the compare-exchange items.

Using reference documents is especially useful when [External Replication](../../../../server/ongoing-tasks/external-replication.mdx) 
is defined between two databases that need to be synced with unique values.  
The reference documents will replicate to the destination database, 
as opposed to compare-exchange items, which are not externally replicated.

<Admonition type="note" title="">
Sessions which process fields that must be unique should be set to [TransactionMode.CLUSTER_WIDE](../../../../client-api/session/cluster-transaction/overview.mdx).

# The reference document class
class UniquePhoneReference:
    class PhoneReference:
        def __init__(self, Id: str = None, company_id: str = None):

        new_company = Company(

        def create_company_with_unique_phone(new_company: Company) -> None:

            with store.open_session(

            ) as session:

                if phone_ref_document is not None:
