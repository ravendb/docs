* When making a query, each document in the query results is assigned a **score**.  
  This score determines the order by which the documents come back in the results when requesting   
  to [order by score](../../../../client-api/session/querying/sort-query-results.mdx#order-by-score).

* Each document in the results includes this score under the `@index-score` property in its metadata.

* Use `includeExplanations` to get the score details and see how it was calculated.  

    <Admonition type="info" title="">
    * Including explanations is available only when using **Lucene** as the underlying search engine.
    * You can configure which search engine will be used. Learn how in [Selecting the search engine](../../../../indexes/search-engine/corax.mdx#selecting-the-search-engine).
