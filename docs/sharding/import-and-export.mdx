# Sharding: Import and Export
<Admonition type="note" title="">

* Smuggler is a RavenDB interface with which data can be 
  exported from a database into a dump file and imported 
  from a dump file into a database.  
  Learn to use Smuggler [here](../client-api/smuggler/what-is-smuggler.mdx).  

* Smuggler is operated using the same API when the database 
  is sharded and when it isn't, and the same set of features 
  is available in both cases.  
  E.g., a [transform script](../client-api/smuggler/what-is-smuggler.mdx#transformscript) 
  can be used to filter and structure the transferred data 
  when the database is sharded and when it is non-sharded.  

* **Studio** can also be used to 
  [export](../studio/database/tasks/export-database.mdx) 
  and [import](../studio/database/tasks/import-data/import-data-file.mdx) 
  data from and to a sharded database, the same way it is 
  done with a non-sharded database.  
  Behind the scenes, Studio uses Smuggler to perform these operations.

## Export

When smuggler is called to 
[export](../client-api/smuggler/what-is-smuggler.mdx#export) 
a sharded database:  

* The client sends an export request to the orchestrator.  
* The orchestrator forwards the request to all other shards.  
* All shards stream their data to the client machine, where the data is gathered in a single `.ravendbdump` file.  
  <Admonition type="note" title="">
  The amount of time it takes to complete the export process depends 
  upon factors like shards' databases sizes, network performance, and 
  the user-defined transform script.

See a code example [here](../client-api/smuggler/what-is-smuggler.mdx#example).  

<Admonition type="warning" title="Casting Smuggler Results" id="casting-smuggler-results" href="#casting-smuggler-results">
In a sharded database, results are returned by Smuggler, Import, and Export 
in a `ShardedSmugglerResult` type. This type is specific to a sharded database, 
and casting it using a non-sharded type [will fail](../../migration/client-api/client-breaking-changes.mdx#casting-smuggler-results).  
</Admonition>



## Import

Smuggler can be used to [import](../client-api/smuggler/what-is-smuggler.mdx#import) 
data into a database from either a [.ravendbdump](../sharding/import-and-export.mdx#export) 
file or from backup files (full or incremental).  

When data is imported into a sharded database one of the shard nodes 
is appointed **orchestrator**; the orchestrator retrieves items from 
the `.ravendbdump` or backup files, gathers the imported items into 
batches, and distributes them among the shards.  

## Importing data from a `.ravendbdump` file

There are no preliminary requirements regarding the structure 
or contents of the database the data is imported to.  

* The data can be imported into a long-existing database, 
  as well as into a database just created.  
* The data can be imported into both sharded and non-sharded databases.  
  In both cases, the data will be retrieved into the database from 
  a local `.ravendbdump` file.  
* If the database is sharded, the imported data will be distributed among the shards.  
  In case the shard has [several nodes](../sharding/overview.mdx#shard-replication), 
  each shard database will be replicated to all the nodes of this shard.  

See a code example [here](../client-api/smuggler/what-is-smuggler.mdx#example-1).

in a `ShardedSmugglerResult` type. This type is specific to a sharded database,

## Importing data from backup files

* Backup files are given an extension that reflects the backup type.  
  A full-backup file, for example, will be given a `.ravendb-full-backup` 
  extension.  
  Regardless of the extension, the internal structure of backup 
  files is similar to that of `.ravendbdump` files.  
  It **is** therefore possible to import backup files.  
* Unlike the [restore](../client-api/operations/maintenance/backup/restore.mdx) operation, 
  which creates a new database from the backup files, importing 
  a backup file adds the imported data to data already stored in 
  the database.  
* Import can be helpful in the following cases, among others:  
   * a backup created for a non-sharded database can be imported 
     into a sharded database.  
     This allows the migration of data from a non-sharded database 
     to a sharded one.  
   * When a sharded database is backed up, each shard creates a backup 
     of its own database. If you want to split the sharded database 
     into multiple databases, you can simply import the backup of each 
     shard into a newly created (sharded or not) database.  

<Admonition type="note" title="">
[Incremental backups](../server/ongoing-tasks/backup-overview.mdx#backup-scope:-full-or-incremental) 
contain only the changes that have been made in the database since the last full backup.  
Import the full backup first, and then the incremental backups that complement it.

## Export and Import Options Summary

| Option | Available on a Sharded Database | Comment |
| -------------------- | --------------- | --------------------- |
| Export and Import [.ravendbdump](../sharding/import-and-export.mdx#export) files using [Smuggler](../client-api/smuggler/what-is-smuggler.mdx) | **Yes** | Smuggler behaves just like it does on non-sharded databases. |
| [Export](../studio/database/tasks/export-database.mdx) and [import](../studio/database/tasks/import-data/import-data-file.mdx) sharded database data using Studio | **Yes** | Behind the scenes, Studio uses Smuggler. |
| Export to **client machine** | **Yes** |  |
| Export to **local shard node storage** | **No** |  |
| Export to **remote locations** like S3, Azure, or Google Cloud | **No** | |
| Import from a `.ravendbdump` file | **Yes** | An orchestrator is appointed to distribute the data among the shards. |
| Import from **Backup files** | **Yes** | **Importing** data from a backup file does **not** create a new database like running the [restore process](../sharding/backup-and-restore/restore.mdx) over the backup file would, but **adds the data** to the existing database by distributing it among the shards. |
| Import from **Full backup files** | **Yes** |  |
| Import from **Incremental backup files** | **Yes** |  |
