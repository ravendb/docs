To send **multiple operations** in a **single request**, reducing the number of remote calls and allowing several operations to share **same transaction**, `Batch` should be used.

## Syntax

<TabItem value="batch_1" label="batch_1">
<CodeBlock language="java">
{`public BatchResult[] batch(List<ICommandData> commandDatas);
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

| Parameters | | |
| ------------- | ------------- | ----- |
| An array of following commands:&lt;br /&gt;- [PutCommandData](../../../../glossary/put-command-data.mdx)&lt;br /&gt;- [DeleteCommandData](../../../../glossary/delete-command-data.mdx)&lt;br /&gt;- [PatchCommandData](../../../../glossary/patch-command-data.mdx)&lt;br /&gt;- [ScriptedPatchCommandData](../../../../glossary/scripted-patch-command-data.mdx) | ICommandData | Commands to process. |

| Return Value | |
| ------------- | ----- |
| [BatchResult](../../../../glossary/batch-result.mdx)[] | An array of batch results matching **exactly** the order of commands send. |

## Example

<TabItem value="batch_2" label="batch_2">
<CodeBlock language="java">
{`Product product1 = new Product();
product1.setName("My Product");
product1.setSupplier("suppliers/999");
PutCommandData put1 = new PutCommandData("products/999", null, RavenJObject.fromObject(product1), new RavenJObject());

Supplier supplier = new Supplier();
supplier.setName("My Supplier");
PutCommandData put2 = new PutCommandData("suppliers/999", null, RavenJObject.fromObject(supplier), new RavenJObject());

DeleteCommandData delete = new DeleteCommandData("products/2", null);

BatchResult[] results = store.getDatabaseCommands().batch(Arrays.<ICommandData> asList(put1, put2, delete));
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

## Concurrency

If an ETag is specified in the command, that ETag is compared to the current ETag on the document on the server. If the ETag does not match, a 409 Conflict status code will be returned from the server, causing a **ConcurrencyException** to be thrown. In such a case, the entire operation fails and non of the updates that were attempted will succeed.

## Transactions

All the operations in the batch will succeed or fail as a transaction. Other users will not be able to see any of the changes until the entire batch completes.
