# Documents: Patch View
---

{NOTE: }

* Use the **Patch View** to apply an update on your documents in a single operation.  
* A patch includes a **query** that finds the documents you want to update, and an **update operation**.  
* Read more about patching [here](../../../client-api/operations/patching/set-based).  

* In this page:  
  * [Patch View](../../../studio/database/documents/patch-view#patch-view)  
  * [Patch Configuration](../../../studio/database/documents/patch-view#patch-configuration)  
  * [Apply Patch](../../../studio/database/documents/patch-view#apply-patch)  
  * [Test Patch](../../../studio/database/documents/patch-view#test-patch)

1. **Save Patch**  
   Click to save the currently displayed patch in the local browser storage.  
   ![Save Patch](images/patch-view-save-patch.png "Save Patch")  
   Enter a name and click the Save button again to save the patch.  
2. **Load Patch**  
   Click to load a stored patch.  
   Recent (unsaved) patches will also be shown/listed here.  
   ![Load Patch](images/patch-view-load-patch.png "Load Patch")  
   Hover over a patch name to display its preview.  
   Click the patch name or the preview **Load** button to load the patch.  
3. **Patch Settings**  
   ![Patch Settings](images/patch-view-settings.png "Patch Settings")  

    * a. **Patch immediately**  
         When this option is selected, clicking the **Apply Patch** button applies 
         the patch immediately.  

    * b. **Define timeout to wait for index to become non-stale**  
         When this option is selected, clicking the **Apply Patch** button 
         applies the patch only after the index used by the patch has become 
         [non-stale](../../../indexes/indexing-basics#stale-indexes).  
         If the index remains stale for the duration of the set timeout, 
         the operation is canceled and an exception is thrown.  
         ![Patch Timeout](images/patch-view-timeout.png "Patch Timeout")  

    * c. **Disable creating new Auto-Indexes**  
         If toggled ON, the patch command will not create an auto-index if there is no existing index that serves the patch.  
         In that case, an exception will be thrown. 
         * Toggling this ON will not affect Auto-Index creation in future Studio patch requests.
           To disable all future Auto-Index creation from Studio patches, change the default setting in [Studio Configuration](../../../studio/database/settings/studio-configuration#disabling-auto-index-creation-on-studio-queries-or-patches)

    * d. **Limit number of operations**  
         Toggle this option ON to set the max number of patch operations per second.
