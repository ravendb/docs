* A __Faceted Search__ provides an efficient way to explore and navigate through large datasets or search results.  

* To make a faceted search,  
  a static-index must be defined for the fields you want to query and apply facets on.  
  Please refer to article __Query by Facets__ under [Indexes &gt; Querying &gt; Faceted search](../../../../indexes/querying/faceted-search.mdx).
