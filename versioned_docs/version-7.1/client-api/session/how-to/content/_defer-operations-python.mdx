* The `defer` method allows you to register server commands via the session.

* All the deferred requests will be stored in the session and sent to the server 
  in a single batch when `save_changes` is called, along with any other changes/operations 
  made on the session.  
  Thus, all deferred commands are **executed as part of the session's `save_changes` transaction**.

## Defer commands example

<TabItem value="defer_1" label="defer_1">
<CodeBlock language="python">
{`# Defer is available in the session's advanced methods
session.advanced.defer(
    # Define commands to be executed:
    # i.e. Put a new document
    PutCommandDataBase(
        "products/999-A",
        None,
        \{"Name": "My Product", "Supplier": "suppliers/1-A", "@metadata": \{"@collection": "Products"\}\},
    ),
    # Patch document
    PatchCommandData("products/999-A", None, PatchRequest("this.Supplier = 'suppliers/2-A'"), None),
    # Force a revision to be created
    ForceRevisionCommandData("products/999-A"),
    # Delete a document
    DeleteCommandData("products/1-A", None),
)

# All deferred commands will be sent to the server upon calling save_changes
session.save_changes()
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
