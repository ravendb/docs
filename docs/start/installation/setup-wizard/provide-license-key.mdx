* After selecting the setup method as described in [Choose setup method](../../../start/installation/setup-wizard/choose-setup-method.mdx),
  the next step is to enter your **license key**.
    
* Each RavenDB cluster must be registered with its own license.  
  The license key is sent to the email address you provided when obtaining it.   
    
* The license grants legal permission to use RavenDB in production,
  unlocks features based on license type (AGPL features only without a license),
  defines cluster and hardware limits, and enables support, updates, and SLA.  
  Learn more about licensing in [Licensing overview](../../../licensing/overview.mdx).  
    
* In this article:
  * [Enter license key](../../../start/installation/setup-wizard/provide-license-key.mdx#enter-license-key)  
  * [Get a free license](../../../start/installation/setup-wizard/provide-license-key.mdx#get-a-free-license)
