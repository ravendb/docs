* RavenDB allows you to store binary data, such as images, PDFs, videos, or any other file, as attachments to your documents.
  Each attachment is associated with a specific document and is identified by a unique name, along with an optional content type (e.g. _image/png_, _application/pdf_).

* A single document can have any number of attachments, the attachments are listed in the document’s metadata.

* Attachments can be stored locally on your RavenDB server or remotely in external storage such as Amazon S3 or Azure Storage.

  * **Local storage**:  
    By default, attachments are stored locally in RavenDB's internal storage.  
    They are stored separately from the document itself in a dedicated attachment storage.  
    This avoids bloating your JSON document with large binary content.    
    See [Store attachments in local storage](../../document-extensions/attachments/store-attachments/store-attachments-local.mdx).
  * **Remote storage**:  
    Optionally, to reduce local storage usage, you can configure RavenDB to offload attachments to remote storage.
    See [Store attachments in remote storage](../../document-extensions/attachments/store-attachments/store-attachments-remote.mdx).
