### Developer license

* The developer license is for development use only and isn't applicable for commercial use.  
  You must upgrade this license before going into production.   
* It is fully featured but temporary - the license lasts 6 months and can be renewed.  
* Certificates whose expiration period exceeds 4 months **cannot** be used with this license.  
  Automatic renewal of Let’s Encrypt certificates is disabled.  
* When you are ready to go into production:  
   * Be sure to choose a license that offers all the features with which your client was developed.  
     <Admonition type="note" title="Note">
     If you use [Let's encrypt](../start/installation/setup-wizard#secure-setup-with-a-free-lets-encrypt-certificate) for the new license, you will not be able to simply replace the license since you are using a dev subdomain.  
     Instead, you can create a new cluster.  
      </Admonition>
   * [Upgrade to a production license](https://ravendb.net/buy) and then [replace](../licensing/replace-license.mdx) the developer license.  
* The developer license can be obtained [here](https://ravendb.net/buy#developer).

### Community license

* A basic production-grade license.
* Community licenses last one year and can be renewed every year.  
* Servers using a Community license are **required to run the latest major version**.  
  E.g., if RavenDB `7.0` is released and your server runs RavenDB `6.2` with a Community license, 
  you will be required to upgrade RavenDB to version `7.0`.  
  Running RavenDB of an older version than the latest with a Community license will **block your 
  server's access to Studio**.  
  <Admonition type="note" title="Grace Period" id="grace-period" href="#grace-period">
  If you run your server with a Community license and a new RavenDB major version is released, 
  Studio will continue to function for **14 days** before it is blocked.  
  During this period, a pop-up notification will show when Studio is started:  

  ![Grace period](./assets/grace-period.png)

  You can: 
   * **Close the notification and keep on working**  
     For 14 days, after which Studio will be blocked until the server is upgraded or the license replaced.  
   * **Replace your license**  
     Acquire a non community license that allows you to use an older version.  
   * **Download a new server version**  
     Upgrade to the latest major version.

<Panel heading="ISV Bank-of-Cores license">

An ISV Bank-of-Cores license allows you to generate RavenDB licenses on your own for a given number of cores.  
If you purchase a 128-cores license, for example, you can use it to generate 8 licenses for 8-core machines, 
16 licenses for 4-core machines, or any other combination that suits your needs.  

* Available bank-of-cores license types are: Essential, Professional, and Enterprise.  
* The same license type, allowing the same feature set, is available for all generated sublicenses.  
  E.g., if the license type you acquire includes the AI integration feature, this feature will be 
  enabled by all the sublicenses you create.  
* [Contact RavenDB for more details](https://ravendb.net/contact).

## Generating bank-of-cores licenses

* When you purchase a bank-of-cores license, you are given a login key.

     ![License generation login page](./assets/bank-of-cores_login-key.png)

* You will be requested to provide an email address associated with your license key.  
  Authorizing license generation through your email provides an additional security layer.  
  You can contact RavenDB's support to associate your key with additional addresses or with 
  all addresses of a given domain.  

     ![License generation login page](./assets/bank-of-cores_login-email.png)
