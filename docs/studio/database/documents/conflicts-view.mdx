# Documents: Conflicts View
<Admonition type="note" title="">

* Manually resolve a conflict between two documents in this view.  

* For a conflict overview see: [What is a Conflict](../../../server/clustering/replication/replication-conflicts.mdx)  

* Note:  
  By default, conflicts are resolved using the latest document version when no script is defined.  
  Conflicts will be created _only if_ this option is unchecked in [Conflict Resolution](../../../studio/database/settings/conflict-resolution.mdx).
