#Immutable entities with Raven DB

Whenever you are trying to use a non-default constructor for your entity, do the following to avoid falling into serialization problems with JSON.Net and raven:

* add a private constructor ... even if it is empty
* Ensure every readonly property has a "Private setter" on it ... else it won't get populated
* Use a custom Json resolver like this one:

<TabItem value="immutable_entities_1" label="immutable_entities_1">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`public class PrivatePropertySetterResolver : DefaultContractResolver
\{
	protected override JsonProperty CreateProperty(MemberInfo member, MemberSerialization memberSerialization)
	\{
		var prop = base.CreateProperty(member, memberSerialization);
		if (!prop.Writable)
		\{
			var property = member as PropertyInfo;
			if (property != null)
			\{
				var hasPrivateSetter = property.GetSetMethod(true) != null;
				prop.Writable = hasPrivateSetter;
			\}
		\}

		return prop;
	\}
\}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
