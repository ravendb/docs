* Existing compare-exchange items can be deleted.  

* An item is deleted only if the index you provide in the request matches the current index stored on the server  
  for the specified key.
  
* Compare-exchange items can also be deleted by adding an expiration date to them.  
  Learn more in [Compare-exchange expiration](../compare-exchange/cmpxchg-expiration).
  
* Whenever a compare-exchange item is deleted, a compare-exchange tombstone item is created for it.  
  Tombstones are used to indicate to other RavenDB processes that the item was deleted, so they can react accordingly.  
  E.g., indexes referencing the deleted item will update themselves to remove those references.  
  The tombstones themselves are not removed immediately - RavenDB uses an internal cleaner task to periodically remove tombstones that are eligible for deletion.
  See: [Cluster.CompareExchangeTombstonesCleanupIntervalInMin](../compare-exchange/configuration#clustercompareexchangetombstonescleanupintervalinmin).

## Delete compare-exchange item using a store operation

* Use the `DeleteCompareExchangeValueOperation` [store operation](../client-api/operations/what-are-operations) to delete a compare-exchange item by its key and index, without opening a session.
  This is ideal for stand-alone tasks where you need to perform a direct compare-exchange operation without involving document transactions.   
  
* The delete operation will only succeed if the item's current index on the server is the same as the one you provide.  
  If the indexes do not match, the item is not deleted and no exception is thrown.

* Example:

    <Tabs groupId='languageSyntax'>
    <TabItem value="Delete_operation" label="Delete_operation">
    ```java
    // Get the latest version of the existing compare-exchange item to be deleted
    CompareExchangeValue<User> itemToDelete = store.operations().send(
        new GetCompareExchangeValueOperation<>(User.class, "AdminUser"));
    
    // Execute the delete operation 
    CompareExchangeResult<User> deleteResult = store.operations().send(
        new DeleteCompareExchangeValueOperation<>(User.class, "AdminUser", itemToDelete.getIndex()));    
    
    // Check results    
    boolean deleteResultSuccessful = deleteResult.isSuccessful();
    ```
    </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

### `DeleteCompareExchangeValueOperation`  
Delete compare-exchange item using a store operation: 

<TabItem value="" label="">
```java
public DeleteCompareExchangeValueOperation(Class<T> clazz, String key, long index)
```
</TabItem>

| Parameter | Type     | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| **key**   | `string` | The unique key of the compare-exchange item. |
| **index** | `long`   | The current version of the item.<br/>Deletion will only succeed if this matches the version stored on the server. |

**Returned object**:

<TabItem value="" label="">
```java
public class CompareExchangeResult<T> {
  private T value;
  private long index;
  private boolean successful;

  public T getValue() {
      return value;
  }

  public void setValue(T value) {
      this.value = value;
  }

  public long getIndex() {
      return index;
  }

  public void setIndex(long index) {
      this.index = index;
  }

  public boolean isSuccessful() {
      return successful;
  }

  public void setSuccessful(boolean successful) {
      this.successful = successful;
  }
}
```
</TabItem>

| Return Value  | Type      | Description |
|---------------|-----------|-------------|
| **Successful**| `boolean` | <ul><li>`true` if the delete operation completed successfully.</li><li>`true` if _key_ doesn't exist</li><li>`false` if the delete operation has failed, e.g. when the index version doesn't match.</li></ul> |
| **Value**     | `T`       | <ul><li>The value that was deleted upon a successful delete.</li><li>`null` if _key_ doesn't exist</li><li>The currently existing value on the server if the delete operation has failed.</li></ul> |
| **Index**     | `long`    | <ul><li>The next available version number upon success.</li><li>The next available version number if _key_ doesn't exist.</li><li>The currently existing index on the server if the delete operation has failed.</li></ul> |
