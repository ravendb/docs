## What is NoSQL?

NoSQL refers to a set of technologies designed to store data in a non-relational manner.

At the time of this writing, a vast majority of applications store data in an RDBMS - a **R**elational **D**ata**b**ase **M**anagement **S**ystem.  NoSQL databases offer an alternative to the RDBMS style of data storage, shedding the rigid, table-based system used in an RDBMS, in place of a different storage model that emphasizes higher scalability and availability over conformant to a relational model.

RavenDB is a powerful and scalable document database.

### Classes of NoSQL Solutions

Most NoSQL solutions store data using one of the following models:

* Document Database
* Key-Value store
* Graph Database

While in theory, any solution can be used to store any type of data, different data storage scenarios are often better suited to one of the available models.
