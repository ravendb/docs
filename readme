This repository contains the official RavenDB documentation

The compiled old book can still be downloaded as a PDF from [http://builds.hibernatingrhinos.com/download/2254](http://builds.hibernatingrhinos.com/download/2254)

The documentation is written using the [Markdown language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), and may use some extended Markdown features.

--------------------

* Images should be stored under a local "images" folder, right below the document referencing them. The reference should be to "images/image_name.png". Image names should bear a unique descriptive name, like clientapi_intro_serverimage.png.

* Links to other documents within the documentation system should be relative, without the .markdown extension, e.g. href="../../server/deployment".

The following non-standard syntax is supported as well:

* For code blocks (supported: json, csharp, plain):

	{CODE-START:json /}
	...
	{CODE-END /}

* For highlighted blocks:

	{BLOCK ... /}
	{NOTE ... /}
	{INFO ... /}
	{WARNING ... /}
	{TIP ... /}
	{WARNING ... /}

* For a files list - will output a list of links to all child documents:

	{FILES-LIST /}

# RavenDB Documentation Ideas

- How big can documents be?
- How many writes per second does RavenDB support?
- what's new in 2.0: http://nosql.mypopescu.com/post/40015290699/ravendb-2-0-is-out-over-6-months-of-features
- monitor RavenDB: https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/ravendb/SVLJeyObA9s

# Working with Markdown Documents

With Visual Studio 2012, the (Web Essentials 2012)[http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/07d54d12-7133-4e15-becb-6f451ea3bea6] extension will let you edit the Markdown and give a good preview once you hit save

# Generating Documentation from Markdown Source

- TODO: generate docs as pdf (like little mongodb book, etc)
- see instructions for the Little MongoDB Book (https://github.com/karlseguin/the-little-mongodb-book/blob/master/readme.markdown)
- on windows - install pandoc @ http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/installing.html
