# Replace License

* To upgrade RavenDB from a version older than `6.x` to version `6.x` and above, you must upgrade your license key before applying it to your new RavenDB. Learn [below](../licensing/replace-license#upgrade-a-license-key-older-than-6-x) how to do this.

<Panel heading="Maintain auto-renewal of Let's Encrypt certificates">

* If you installed RavenDB using the [Setup Wizard](../start/installation/setup-wizard.mdx) and used a Let's Encrypt certificate, contact [customer support](https://ravendb.net/contact) when changing your license to maintain certificates auto-renewal.  
* If you fail to do so, changing your license ID will cause a mismatch between your new license ID and the ID that Let's Encrypt expects when renewing the certificate.
