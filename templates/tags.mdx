# Tags

## Add a new tag

Tags are defined centrally in `guides/tags.yml` and then referenced from guide
frontmatter.

### Define the tag in `guides/tags.yml`

Each top‑level key is a tag id used in the `tags` array. Example:

```yml
ai:
    label: "AI"
    permalink: "/ai"
    description: "Content related to AI."
```

To add a new tag, append a new entry:

```yml
vector-search:
    label: "Vector search"
    permalink: "/vector-search"
    description: "Guides related to semantic search and embeddings."
```

### Use the tag in a guide

In a guide MDX file, reference the tag by its key:

```mdx
---
title: "Vector search basics"
tags: [ai, vector-search]
image: "/img/guides-vector-search.webp"
description: "Intro to semantic search in RavenDB."
---
```

The `recent-guides-plugin`:

- Reads `guides/tags.yml` and builds a list of known tags
- Counts how many guides use each tag
- Exposes this data to the Guides UI (cards, tag pages, and `TagsGrid`)

<Panel heading="Where tags show up" headingLevel={3}>

- On the Guides home page, under **Browse by topic**, `TagsGrid` shows tags
  with `count > 0` and links to `/guides/tags/<tag>`.
- On guide cards (e.g., in **Recent guides**), selected tags may be rendered
  as labels.
- On individual tag pages, users can browse all guides for a specific topic.

</Panel>

<Admonition type="tip" title="Tagging guidelines">
    - Prefer a **small, focused set** of tags per guide (2–4 is typical). - Reuse existing tags from `guides/tags.yml` whenever possible. - When introducing a new tag, think of it as a "topic bucket" that might contain multiple guides over time.
