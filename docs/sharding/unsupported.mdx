# Sharding: Unsupported Features
<Admonition type="note" title="Note">

* A sharded RavenDB database generally provides the same services that 
  a non-sharded database offers, so clients of older versions and non-sharded 
  database are supported and existing queries, subscriptions, patches, 
  and so on, require no modification.  
* Find below a list of yet unimplemented features, that are currently 
  supported by non-sharded RavenDB databases but not by sharded ones.
