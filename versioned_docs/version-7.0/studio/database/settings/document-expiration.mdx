# Document Expiration 
<Admonition type="note" title="Note">

* Use this view to configure the **Document Expiration** feature.  
* Documents can be scheduled for deletion by an `@expires` property in their `@metadata`.  
* When the document expiration feature is enabled, it routinely checks for documents that 
  include the `@expires` property and deletes them on the scheduled time.  
* Learn more about this option [here](../../../server/extensions/expiration).
