# Time Series Settings
<Admonition type="note" title="Note">

* The **Time Series Settings view** allows you to define and manage time series 
  configurations per collection. Configurations may include:  

    * [Named Values](../../../document-extensions/timeseries/client-api/named-time-series-values.mdx)  
      A customized name can be set per time series value.  
      API methods can access time series values by their names.  
    
    * [Rollup Policies](../../../document-extensions/timeseries/rollup-and-retention.mdx#what-are-rollups)  
      A rollup policy defines a time frame by which data from an origin time series 
      will be aggregated into a new **rollup time series**.  

    * [Retention Periods](../../../document-extensions/timeseries/rollup-and-retention.mdx)  
      A retention period defines how long time series entries are kept.  
      An entry that exceeds this period will be removed.

## Time Series Settings View

!["Time Series Settings View"](./assets/time-series-settings-01_view.png)

1. **Time Series Settings View**  
   Select **Settings** &gt; **Time Series** to open the Time Series Settings View.  
2. **Enable/Disable Rollup & Retention Policies**  
    * Use the **checkbox** to select or deselect all the Rollup and Retention 
      policies defined in your configurations.  
    * Use the **Set status** dropdown list to enable or disable the selected  policies.  
      !["Set Status"](./assets/time-series-settings-02_enable-disable.png)  
       * Disabled policies will **not be executed**.  
       * Enabled policies' **execution frequency** is determined -  
         By the server Policy Check Frequency (see below),  
         **-and-**  
         By the Rollup Time Frame and Retention Period set by each policy.  
         <Admonition type="note" title="When a policy is executed:" id="when-a-policy-is-executed" href="#when-a-policy-is-executed">
         
         * Aggregated entries will be created according to the policy's rollup time frame.  
         * Entries will be removed according to the policy's retention period.  
         </Admonition>
3. **Policy Check Frequency**  
   Set the frequency by which the server checks and executes the Rollup and Retention policies.  
   <Admonition type="note" title="Note">
   Note that any policy defined with a time frame shorter than the server's 
   **Policy Check Frequency** will still be executed at the server checkup time.  
   E.g., If Policy Check Frequency is set to 8 seconds, a retention policy set to 
   2 seconds will still be checked and executed every 8 seconds.  
   </Admonition>

!["Defined Time Series Configurations - Info"](./assets/time-series-settings-04_per-collection-configuration-info.png)

1. **Collection Name**  
   Time series configurations are defined **per collection** (`Companies` in the above image).  

2. **Rollup and Retention Policies Status**  
   The left sidebar indicates whether Rollup and Retention policies 
   in this configuration are enabled or disabled.  

3. **Rollup and Retention Policies**  
   Rollup and Retention policies defined for time series in this collection (`Companies`).  
   !["Defined Configuration - Rollup and Retention"](./assets/time-series-settings-04.1_per-collection-rollup-and-retention.png)
    * **(a) Raw Data**  
      The retention policy for the raw time series entries.
      In this example, entries older than 12 hours will be removed 
      from every raw-data time series in the `Companies` collection.
    * **(b) Rollup Policy for Raw Data**  
       * **Rollup Policy Name**  
         In this example, the policy name is: `ByMinute`.  
         Raw data of time series in the Companies collection will be aggregated 
         into a new rollup time series named: `<raw-timeseries-name>@ByMinute`  
       * **Aggregation**  
         The aggregation period defined by the rollup policy.  
         In this example, every 1 minute of raw data will be aggregated into 
         a single entry of the `ByMinute` rollup time series.
         <Admonition type="note" title="Note">
         An entry is added to the rollup time series only when the 
         defined aggregation time frame has ended.  
         </Admonition>
       * **Retention**  
         The retention period defined for the rollup time series entries.  
         In this example, entries older than 1 hour are removed 
         from the `ByMinute` rollup time series.
    * **(c) Rollup Policy for Rollup Time Series**  
       * **Rollup Policy Name**  
         In this example, the policy name is: `30Mins`.  
         Data from the rollup time series `<raw-timeseries-name>@ByMinute>` 
         will be aggregated into a new rollup time series named: `<raw-timeseries-name>@30Mins`  
       * **Aggregation**  
         The aggregation period defined by the rollup policy.  
         In this example, every 30 minutes of data from the `ByMinute` 
         rollup time series will be aggregated into a single entry of the 
         `30Mins` rollup time series.  
         <Admonition type="note" title="Note">
         An entry is added to the rollup time series only when the defined 
         aggregation time frame has ended.  
         </Admonition>
       * **Retention**  
         The retention period defined for the rollup time series entries.  
         In this example, entries older than 7 days are removed 
         from the `30Mins` rollup time series.

4. **Named Values**  
   Named values defined for time series in this collection (`Companies`).  
   !["Defined Configuration - Named Values"](./assets/time-series-settings-04.2_per-collection-named-values.png)

      The time series for which the names are defined.  
    * **(b) Values and their Names**  
      Time series entries values, in their consecutive order within 
      the entry (#0, #1..), with the name defined for each value.

   Read more [here](../../../studio/database/settings/time-series-settings.mdx#rollup-policies-for-rollup-time-series).  
   </Admonition>
   In the above image, the rollup policy aggregates the **raw data** 
   of the selected collection's time series, into **new** rollup time series.  
   !["Set Rollup Policy"](./assets/time-series-settings-07_rollup.png)  
    * **(a) Policy Name**  
      Enter rollup policy Name  
    * **(b) Aggregation Time**  
      Set the aggregation period

      into a single entry of the new rollup time series.  
    * **(c) Enable Retention**  
      Enable to set a retention time period for the new rollup time series entries.
      <Admonition type="note" title="Note">
      The **aggregation time** cannot exceed the **retention period** 
      defined for the origin time series.  
      </Admonition>

6. **Add Named Values**  
   !["Named Values"](./assets/time-series-settings-08_named-values.png)

   you click the **Save** button (9).  
   </Admonition>
8. **Cancel**  
   Click to cancel.  
9. **Save**  
   Save all the modifications made in this view.  




## Rollup Policies for Rollup Time Series

* Rollup policies can be created both for **Raw time series data**, 
  and for **data aggregated by other rollup time series**.  
* In a time series configuration, a rollup policy's source data 
  is determined by the policy's position.  
   * The **first** rollup policy aggregates **raw data** from 
     time series of the selected collection.  
   * The **second** rollup policy aggregates data **from 
     the first rollup time series**.  
   * And so on: each additional rollup policy aggregates data from the 
     time series that precedes it.

<Admonition type="note" title="Note">

* The Aggregation Time set by each policy must be **greater** than the 
  aggregation time set for the previous policy.  
* The Aggregation Time **cannot exceed** the Retention Period defined for the 
  previous time series.
</Admonition>

!["Rollup Policies for Rollup Time Series"](./assets/time-series-settings-09_rollup-time-series.png)  


1. **Time Series Raw Data**  
   The raw data collected in time series of the selected collection.  

2. **Rollup Time Series for Raw Data**  
   The `ByMinute` rollup policy aggregates raw data from time series 
   in the `Companies` collection.  
   Every minute of raw time series data, is aggregated into 
   a single entry of the new rollup time series.  

3. **Rollup Time Series for Rollup Time Series**  
   The `30Mins` rollup policy aggregates data from the rollup time series 
   that was created by the `ByMinute` policy.  
   Every 30 minutes of data from the `ByMinute` rollup time series, 
   are aggregated into a single entry of the new `30Mins` rollup time series.
