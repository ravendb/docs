#Immutable entities with Raven DB

Whenever you are trying to use a non-default constructor for your entity, do the following to avoid falling into serialization problems with JSON.Net and raven:

* add a private constructor ... even if it is empty
* Ensure every readonly property has a "Private setter" on it ... else it won't get populated
* Use a custom Json resolver like this one:


        
```
public class PrivatePropertySetterResolver : DefaultContractResolver
        {
           protected override JsonProperty CreateProperty(JsonObjectContract contract, MemberInfo member)
           {
               var prop = base.CreateProperty(contract, member);
               if (!prop.Writable)
               {
                   var property = member as PropertyInfo;
                   if (property != null)
                   {
                       var hasPrivateSetter = property.GetSetMethod(true) != null;
                       prop.Writable = hasPrivateSetter;
                   }
               }
               return prop;
           }
        }
```
