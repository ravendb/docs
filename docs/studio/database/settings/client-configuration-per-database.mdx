* You can **override** the [server-wide client configuration](../../../studio/server/client-configuration.mdx) per database:  
  You can do this using:  
  * The Studio - as described in this article  
  * The Client API - see [Put client configuration operation](../../../client-api/operations/maintenance/configuration/put-client-configuration.mdx)  
    
* When set from the Studio, the client configuration is stored directly on the RavenDB server  
  and applies to any client that connects to the specific database.
   
* These settings override the client's own configuration,  
  which was initially set in your application code when initializing the _DocumentStore_.  
  This enables administrators to dynamically control client behavior, even after the client has started running.  
  For example, adjusting load balancing behavior on the fly in response to changing system demands.

* In this article:
  * [Set the client configuration (for database)](../../../studio/database/settings/client-configuration-per-database.mdx#set-the-client-configuration-for-database)

1. Go to **Settings > Client Configuration**

2. Select whether to override the server-wide client configuration:  
   Toggle **"Use server config"** to make this database use the settings defined [server-wide](../../../studio/server/client-configuration.mdx).  
   Toggle **"Use database config"** to override the server-wide settings with a configuration specific to this database.
    
3. **Identity parts separator**  
   Set the **separator character** for automatically generated document IDs of type **identity**.  
   You can use any single character except `|` (pipe).  
   Default value: `/`  
   This setting affects only IDs for identity documents created by the server.  
   Learn more about identities in [Document identifier generation: Identity](../../../server/kb/document-identifier-generation.mdx#strategy-identity). 

4. **Maximum number of requests per session**  
   Set this number to restrict the number of requests (***Reads*** & ***Writes***) allowed per session when using the Client API.  
   Default value: `30`  

5. **Load balance behavior**  
    Set the Load balance method for ***Read*** & ***Write*** requests.  
    For a detailed explanation see: [Load balance behavior](../../../client-api/configuration/load-balance/load-balance-behavior.mdx).  
    
    Available options:  
    * [None](../../../client-api/configuration/load-balance/load-balance-behavior.mdx#none-default-option): (default)  
      Read requests - the node the client will target will be based on the "Read balance behavior" configuration.  
      Write requests - will be sent to the [preferred node](../../../client-api/configuration/load-balance/overview.mdx#the-preferred-node).  
    * [Use session context](../../../client-api/configuration/load-balance/load-balance-behavior.mdx#usesessioncontext):  
      Select this option to allow sessions to control load balancing using a "context string".  
      With this option selected, the session determines the target node for all ***Read*** & ***Write*** requests by **hashing**:  
      * the session's "context string" (set in the client session),  
      * and an optional seed value (set here or in the client session).  
      
      All sessions that use the same "context string" and the same seed will route their requests to the same node.  
      This gives you fine-grained control over how requests are distributed across the cluster based on how you assign "context strings" and "seeds".

6. **Read balance behavior**  
   Set the "Read_ balance method" the client will use when accessing a node with ***Read*** requests.  
   The selected method also affects how the client chooses a failover node for ***Read*** requests.  
   For a detailed explanation see: [Read balance behavior](../../../client-api/configuration/load-balance/read-balance-behavior.mdx).  
   
    Available options:  
     * [None](../../../client-api/configuration/load-balance/read-balance-behavior.mdx#none-default-option) (default)  
     * [Round Robin](../../../client-api/configuration/load-balance/read-balance-behavior.mdx#roundrobin)  
     * [Fastest Node](../../../client-api/configuration/load-balance/read-balance-behavior.mdx#fastestnode)
