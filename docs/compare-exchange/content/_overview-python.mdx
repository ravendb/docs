## What compare-exchange items are

Compare-exchange items are key/value pairs where the key serves as a unique value across your database.

* Each compare-exchange item contains: 
  * **A key** - A unique string identifier in the database scope.
  * **A value** - Can be any object (a number, string, array, or any valid JSON object). 
  * **Metadata** - Optional data that is associated with the compare-exchange item. Must be a valid JSON object.  
    For example, the metadata can be used to set expiration time for the compare-exchange item.  
    Learn more in [compare-exchange expiration](../compare-exchange/cmpxchg-expiration).  
  * **Raft index** - The compare-exchange item's version.  
    Any change to the value or metadata will increase this number.  

* Creating and modifying a compare-exchange item is an atomic, thread-safe [compare-and-swap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compare-and-swap)
  interlocked compare-exchange operation. These operations require cluster consensus to ensure consistency across all nodes.  
  Once a consensus is reached, the compare-exchange items are distributed through the Raft algorithm to all nodes in the database group.

## Ways to create and manage compare-exchange items
  
Compare exchange items can be created and managed using any of the following approaches:

* **Document Store Operations**  
  You can create and manage compare-exchange items using _document store_ operations.  
  For example, see [Create items using a store operation](../compare-exchange/create-cmpxchg-items#create-items-using-a-store-operation).

* **Cluster-Wide Sessions**  
  You can create and manage compare-exchange items from within a [Cluster-Wide session](../client-api/session/cluster-transaction/overview#cluster-wide-transaction-vs-single-node-transaction).  
  For example, see [Create items using a cluster-wide session](../compare-exchange/create-cmpxchg-items#create-items-using-a-cluster-wide-session).     
  When using a cluster-wide session, the compare-exchange item is created as part of the cluster-wide transaction.  
  If the session fails, the item creation also fails, and none of the nodes in the database group will store the new compare-exchange item.
  
* **Atomic Guards**  
  When creating _documents_ using a cluster-wide session, RavenDB automatically creates [Atomic Guards](../compare-exchange/atomic-guards),  
  which are special compare-exchange items that guarantee ACID transactions.  
  See [Cluster-wide transaction vs. Single-node transaction](../client-api/session/cluster-transaction/overview#cluster-wide-transaction-vs-single-node-transaction) for a session comparison overview.  

* **Studio**  
  All compare-exchange items can also be managed from the **Compare-Exchange view** in the [Studio](../todo..):  
    
    ![The compare-exchange view](../assets/the-cmpxchg-view.png)

    1. Open the **Documents** section in the Studio sidebar.
    2. Click on the **Compare-Exchange** tab.
    3. This is a compare-exchange item.  
       In this view you can create, edit, and delete compare-exchange items.

## Why compare-exchange items are not replicated to external databases 

* Each cluster defines its own policies and configurations, and should ideally have sole responsibility for managing its own documents. 
  Read [Consistency in a Globally Distributed System](https://ayende.com/blog/196769-B/data-ownership-in-a-distributed-system) 
  to learn more about why global database modeling is more efficient this way.
   
* When creating a compare-exchange item, a Raft consensus is required from the nodes in the database group.
  Externally replicating such data is problematic because the target database may reside within a cluster that is in an
  unstable state where Raft decisions cannot be made. In such a state, the compare-exchange item will not be persisted in the target database.

* Conflicts between documents that occur between two databases are resolved using the documents' change-vector. 
  Compare-exchange conflicts cannot be resolved in the same way, as they lack a similar conflict resolution mechanism.

* To ensure unique values between two databases without using compare-exchange items see [Example III](../compare-exchange/overview#example-iii---ensuring-unique-values-without-using-compare-exchange).

* Learn more about Replication in RavenDB in [Replication overview](../server/clustering/replication/replication-overview).
  For details about what is and what isn't replicated in [What is Replicated](../server/ongoing-tasks/external-replication#what-is-replicated).

## Example I - Email address reservation  

The following example shows how to use compare-exchange to create documents with unique values.  
The scope is within the database group on a single cluster. 

Compare-exchange items are not externally replicated to other databases.  
To establish uniqueness without using compare-exchange see [Example III](../compare-exchange/overview#example-iii---ensuring-unique-values-without-using-compare-exchange).

<TabItem value="" label="">
<CodeBlock language="python">
{`email = "user@example.com"

user = User(email=email)

with store.open_session() as session:
    session.store(user)
    # At this point, the user document has an Id assigned

    # Try to reserve a new user email
    # Note: This operation takes place outside the session transaction,
    # It is a cluster-wide reservation
    cmp_xchg_result = store.operations.send(PutCompareExchangeValueOperation(f"emails/\{email\}", user.Id, 0))

    if cmp_xchg_result.successful is False:
        raise RuntimeError("Email is already in use")

    # At this point we managed to reserve/save the user mail -
    # The document can be saved in save_changes
    session.save_changes()
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>  

**Implications**:

* This compare-exchange item was [created as an operation](../compare-exchange/create-cmpxchg-items#create-items-using-a-store-operation)
  rather than with a [cluster-wide session](../compare-exchange/create-cmpxchg-items#create-items-using-a-cluster-wide-session).  
  Thus, if `session.SaveChanges` fails, then the email reservation is Not rolled back automatically.  
  It is your responsibility to do so.  

* The compare-exchange value that was saved can be accessed in a query using the `CmpXchg` method:  

<Tabs groupId='languageSyntax'>
<TabItem value="Query" label="Query">
<CodeBlock language="python">
{`query = sesion.query(object_type=User).where_equals("Id", CmpXchg.value("emails/ayende@ayende.com"))
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>  
<TabItem value="RQL" label="RQL">
<CodeBlock language="sql">
{`from Users as s where id() == cmpxchg("emails/ayende@ayende.com")
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Example II - Reserve a shared resource  

In the following example, we use compare-exchange to reserve a shared resource.  
The scope is within the database group on a single cluster.

The code also checks for clients which never release resources (i.e. due to failure) by using timeout.  

<TabItem value="" label="">
<CodeBlock language="python">
{`class SharedResource:
    def __init__(self, reserved_until: datetime = None):
        self.reserved_until = reserved_until

def print_work() -> None:
    # Try to get hold of the printer resource
    reservation_index = lock_resource(store, "Printer/First-Floor", timedelta(minutes=20))

    try:
        ...
        # Do some work for the duration that was set
        # Don't exceed the duration, otherwise resource is available for someone else
    finally:
        release_resource(store, "Printer/First-Floor", reservation_index)

def lock_resource(document_store: DocumentStore, resource_name: str, duration: timedelta):
    while True:
        now = datetime.utcnow()

        resource = SharedResource(reserved_until=now + duration)
        save_result = document_store.operations.send(
            PutCompareExchangeValueOperation(resource_name, resource, 0)
        )

        if save_result.successful:
            # resource_name wasn't present - we managed to reserve
            return save_result.index

        # At this point, Put operation failed - someone else owns the lock or lock time expired
        if save_result.value.reserved_until < now:
            # Time expired - Update the existing key with new value
            take_lock_with_timeout_result = document_store.operations.send(
                PutCompareExchangeValueOperation(resource_name, resource, save_result.index)
            )

            if take_lock_with_timeout_result.successful:
                return take_lock_with_timeout_result.index

        # Wait a little bit and retry
        time.sleep(0.02)

def release_resource(store: DocumentStore, resource_name: str, index: int) -> None:
    delete_result = store.operations.send(DeleteCompareExchangeValueOperation(resource_name, index))

    # We have 2 options here:
    # delete_result.successful is True - we managed to release resource
    # delete_result.successful is False - someone else took the lock due to timeout
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

## Example III - Ensuring unique values without using compare-exchange  

Unique values can also be ensured without using compare-exchange.

The below example shows how to achieve that by using **reference documents**.  
The reference documents' IDs will contain the unique values instead of the compare-exchange items.

Using reference documents is especially useful when [External Replication](../server/ongoing-tasks/external-replication) 
is defined between two databases that need to be synced with unique values.  
The reference documents will replicate to the destination database, 
as opposed to compare-exchange items, which are not externally replicated.

<Admonition type="note" title="">
Sessions which process fields that must be unique should be set to [TransactionMode.CLUSTER_WIDE](../client-api/session/cluster-transaction/overview).

<TabItem value="" label="">

# The reference document class
class UniquePhoneReference:
    class PhoneReference:
        def __init__(self, Id: str = None, company_id: str = None):

        new_company = Company(

        )

        def create_company_with_unique_phone(new_company: Company) -> None:

            ) as session:

                    UniquePhoneReference.PhoneReference(company_id=new_company.Id),
                    f"phones/\{new_company.phone\}",
                )
