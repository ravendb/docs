     made available by each type.

## License types

<Admonition type="info" title="">
Visit the [pricing page](https://ravendb.net/buy) to see which features are included with each license type.
</Admonition>
### Developer

* The developer license is for development use only and isn't applicable for commercial use.  
  You must upgrade this license before going into production.   
* It is fully featured but temporary - the license lasts 6 months and can be renewed.  
* Certificates exceeding 4 months expiration period are Not allowed to be used with this license.  
  Automatic renewal of Let’s Encrypt certificates is disabled.  
* When you are ready to go into production:  
   * Be sure to choose a license that has all features with which your client was developed.  
     Note that if you use [Let's encrypt](../../start/installation/setup-wizard.mdx#secure-setup-with-a-free-let) 
     for the new license, you will not be able to simply replace the license since you are 
     using a dev subdomain. Instead, you can create a new cluster.  
   * [Upgrade to a production license](https://ravendb.net/buy) and then [replace](../../start/licensing/replace-license.mdx) the developer license.  
* The developer license can be obtained [here](https://ravendb.net/buy#developer).
### Community

* A basic production-grade license.
* Community licenses last one year and can be renewed every year.  
* Servers using a Community license are **required to run the latest major version**.  
  E.g., if RavenDB `7.0` is released and your server runs RavenDB `6.2` with a Community license, 
  you will be required to upgrade RavenDB to version `7.0`.  
  Running RavenDB of an older version than the latest with a Community license will **block your 
  server's access to Studio**.  
  <Admonition type="note" title="Grace Period" id="grace-period" href="#grace-period">
  If you run your server with a Community license and a new RavenDB major version is released, 
  Studio will continue to function for **14 days** before it is blocked.  
  During this period, a pop-up notification will show when Studio is started:  
  ![Grace period](./assets/grace-period.png)
  You can: 
  
   * **Close the notification and keep on working**  
     For 14 days, after which Studio will be blocked until the server is upgraded or the license replaced.  
   * **Replace your license**  
     Acquire a non community license that allows you to use an older version.  
   * **Download a new server version**  
     Upgrade to the latest major version.  
  
  </Admonition>
### Professional

* A standard production-grade license.  
* Extended automatically if the server has access to RavenDB's License Server.  
### Enterprise

* A high-performance, fully-featured production-grade license.  
* Extended automatically if the server has access to RavenDB's License Server.  
### ISV Licenses

* ISV licenses are commercial licenses that allow you to redistribute RavenDB with your software  
  for on-premise installation and use by your customers.  
* Available ISV license types are: Essential, Professional, and Enterprise.  
* [Contact RavenDB for more details](https://ravendb.net/contact).



## ISV Bank-of-Cores License

An ISV Bank-of-Cores license allows you to generate RavenDB licenses on your own for a given number of cores.  
If you purchase a 128-cores license, for example, you can use it to generate 8 licenses for 8-core machines, 
16 licenses for 4-core machines, or any other combination that suits your needs.  

* Available bank-of-cores license types are: Essential, Professional, and Enterprise.  
* The same license type, allowing the same feature set, is available for all generated sublicenses.  
  E.g., if the license type you acquire includes the AI integration feature, this feature will be 
  enabled by all the sublicenses you create.  
* [Contact RavenDB for more details](https://ravendb.net/contact).
