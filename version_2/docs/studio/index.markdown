# The Management Studio

The RavenDB Management Studio is a lightweight Silverlight client to let you easily manage the data in a RavenDB server instance. Using the Studio you can view, create, edit or delete documents, manage indexes, issue queries, view the errors log, import / export, and more.

The Studio is accessible from any RavenDB server, regardless of how it is deployed. However, it does require the user to authenticate against the server, most commonly using his Windows credentials.
