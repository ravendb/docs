In quotas settings you can set several parameters for the database:  

- **Maximum size**: Limit the size of the database (in MB).
- **Warning limit threshold**: Set on which database size you will get a warning (in MB).
- **Maximum number of docs**: Limit the number of documents the database can hold.
- **Warning threshold for docs**: Set the number of documents that when reached will warn the user.  

Bundle settings can always be adjusted in the database settings view, which you can access from top panel.
