# Backup
---

{NOTE: }

* Create a backup of your data to secure it or to preserve a copy of it in its current state for future reference.  

* RavenDB's Backup task is an [Ongoing-Task](../../../../studio/database/tasks/ongoing-tasks/general-info) 
  designed to run periodically on a pre-defined schedule.  
  You can run it as a one-time operation as well, by using [Export](../../../../client-api/smuggler/what-is-smuggler#export) 
  or executing a backup-task [immediately](../../../../client-api/operations/maintenance/backup/backup#initiate-immediate-backup-execution).

{PANEL: Backup Types}

####Logical-Backup  

* Data is backed-up in [compressed](../../../../server/ongoing-tasks/backup-overview#compression) JSON files.  

* During the restoration, RavenDB -  
   * Re-inserts all data into the database.  
   * Re-indexes the data.  

* Restoration Time is, therefore, **slower** than that required when restoring a Snapshot.  

* Backup file size is **significantly smaller** than that of a Snapshot.

* The following code sample defines a full-backup task that would be executed every 3 hours:  
  {CODE logical_full_backup_every_3_hours@ClientApi\Operations\Maintenance\Backup\Backup.cs /}
  Note the usage of [Cron scheduling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) when setting backup frequency.  

---

####Snapshot

* A SnapShot is a compressed binary duplication of the [database and journals](../../../../server/storage/directory-structure#storage--directory-structure) file structure at a given point-in-time.  
  Snapshot-backups are available only for **Enterprise subscribers**.  
* During restoration -
   * Re-inserting data into the database is not required.  
   * Re-indexing is not required.  

* Restoration is typically **faster** than that of a logical backup.  

* Snapshot size is typically **larger** than that of a logical backup.  

* Code Sample:  
  {CODE backup_type_snapshot@ClientApi\Operations\Maintenance\Backup\Backup.cs /}

####Basic Comparison Between a Logical-Backup and a Snapshot:

  | Backup Type | Stored Format | Restoration speed | Size
  | ------ | ------ | ------ |
  | Snapshot | Compressed Binary Image | Fast | Larger than a logical-backup
  | Logical backup |  Compressed Textual Data | Slow | Smaller than a Snapshot

{NOTE: Make sure your server has access to the local backup path.}
Verify that RavenDB is allowed to store files in the path set in `LocalSettings.FolderPath`.

{PANEL: Backup Scope}

As described in [the overview](../../../../server/ongoing-tasks/backup-overview#backing-up-and-restoring-a-database), a backup task can create **full** and **incremental** backups.  

* A Backup Task can be defined to create either a full data backup or an incremental backup.  
  In both cases, the backup task adds a single new backup file to the backup folder each time it runs,
  leaving the existing backup files untouched.  

---

####Full-Backup


* **File Format**  
  A full-backup is a **compressed JSON file** if it is a logical 
  backup, or a **compressed binary file** if it is a snapshot.  

* **Task Ownership**  
  There are no preliminary conditions for creating a full-backup. 
  Any node can perform this task.  

* **To run a full-backup**  
  Set `FullBackupFrequency`.
  {CODE backup_full_backup@ClientApi\Operations\Maintenance\Backup\Backup.cs /}

---

####Incremental-Backup

* **File Format**  
  An incremental-backup file is **always in JSON format**. 
  It is so even when the full-backup it supplements is a binary snapshot.  

* **Task Ownership**  
  The ownership of an incremental-backup task is granted dynamically by the cluster.  
  An incremental-backup can be executed only by the same node that currently owns the backup task.  
  A node can run an incremental-backup, only after running full-backup at least once.  

* **To run an incremental-backup**  
  Set `IncrementalBackupFrequency`.
  {CODE backup_incremental_backup@ClientApi\Operations\Maintenance\Backup\Backup.cs /}

{PANEL/}

{PANEL: Backup to Local and Remote Destinations}

* Backups can be made **locally**, as well as to a set of **remote locations** including -  
   * A network path
   * An FTP/SFTP target
   * Amazon S3 
   * Azure Storage 
   * Amazon Glacier 

* RavenDB will store data in a local folder first, and transfer it to the remote 
  destination from the local one.  
   * If a local folder hasn't been specified, RavenDB will use the system's **temp** 
     folder as temporary storage and delete the local files when the transfer ends.  
   * If a local folder **has** been specified, RavenDB will use it both for the transfer 
     and as its permanent local backup location.  

* Local and Remote Destinations Settings Code Sample:  
  {CODE backup_remote_destinations@ClientApi\Operations\Maintenance\Backup\Backup.cs /}
 
 {INFO: Tip}
    Use AWS [IAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/introduction_access-management.html) (Identity and Access Management) 
    to restrict users access while they create backups.  
    E.g. -  
    {CODE-BLOCK:json}
        {
            "Version": "2012-10-17",
            "Statement": [
                {
                    "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
                    "Effect": "Allow",
                    "Action": "s3:PutObject",
                    "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::BUCKET_NAME/*"
                },
                {
                    "Sid": "VisualEditor1",
                    "Effect": "Allow",
                    "Action": [
                        "s3:ListBucket",
                        "s3:GetBucketAcl",
                        "s3:GetBucketLocation"
                    ],
                    "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::BUCKET_NAME"
                }
            ]
        }

{PANEL: Initiate Immediate Backup Execution}

The Backup task is [executed periodically](../../../../server/ongoing-tasks/backup-overview#backup--restore-overview) on its predefined schedule.  
If needed, it can also be executed immediately.  

* To execute an existing backup task immediately, use the `StartBackupOperation` method.  
   {CODE initiate_immediate_backup_execution@ClientApi\Operations\Maintenance\Backup\Backup.cs /}

  * Definition:
    {CODE start_backup_operation@ClientApi\Operations\Maintenance\Backup\Backup.cs /}

  * Parameters:
    
        | Parameter | Type | Functionality |
        | ------ | ------ | ------ |
        | isFullBackup | bool | true: full-backup <br> false: incremental-backup |
        | taskId |  long | The existing backup task ID |


* To verify the execution results, use the `GetPeriodicBackupStatusOperation` method.  
  {CODE get_backup_execution_results@ClientApi\Operations\Maintenance\Backup\Backup.cs /}
   * Return Value:  
     The **PeriodicBackupStatus** object returned from **GetPeriodicBackupStatusOperation** is filled with the previously configured backup parameters and with the execution results.  
     {CODE periodic_backup_status@ClientApi\Operations\Maintenance\Backup\Backup.cs /}

{PANEL: Recommended Precautions}
{WARNING: }

* **Don't substitute RavenDB's backup procedures with simply copying the database folder yourself**.  
  The official backup procedure satisfies needs that simply copying the database folder does not. E.g. -  
   * A reliable point-in-time freeze of backed up data.  
   * An ACIDity of backed-up data, to keep its independence during restoration.  
     
* **Remove old backup files regularly**.  
  RavenDB does **not** remove old backup files automatically. 
  As these files continue to aggregate, it is important that you take care of their regular removal.  
  You can use services like crontab (a Linux scheduling procedure) to create an old-backups-removal routine.  

* **Store backup files in a location other than your database's**.  
  Note that backup files are always stored in a local folder first (even when the final backup destination is remote).  
  Make sure that this local folder is not where your database is stored, as a precaution to keep vacant database storage space.
