# Monitoring: SNMP Support

Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is an Internet-standard protocol for collecting and organizing information 
about managed devices on IP networks. It is used primarily for monitoring network services. SNMP exposes management 
data in the form of variables (metrics) which describe the system status and configuration. These metrics can then be 
remotely queried (and, in some circumstances, manipulated) by managing applications.

In RavenDB we have support for SNMP which allows monitoring tools like [Zabbix](https://www.zabbix.com), [PRTG](https://www.paessler.com/prtg) 
and [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/) direct access to the internal details of RavenDB. We expose a long list of metrics: CPU and memory usage,
server total requests, the loaded databases, and also database specific metrics like the number of indexed items per 
second, document writes per second, storage space each database takes, and so on. 

You can still monitor what is going on with RavenDB directly from the Studio, or by using one of our monitoring tools. However, using SNMP might be easier in some cases. 
As users start running large numbers of RavenDB instances, it becomes unpractical to deal with each of them individually and using a monitoring system that can watch many servers is advisable.

### Enabling SNMP in RavenDB

RavenDB is already configured to support SNMP. All you have to do is enable it and restart the server. 
This is done by adding the following key to your [settings.json](../../configuration/configuration-options.mdx#json) file:

<TabItem value="json" label="json">
<CodeBlock language="json">
{`\{
    ...
    "Monitoring.Snmp.Enabled": true
    ...
\}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

There are two configurable SNMP properties in RavenDB: the SNMP port and the community string.   
The default community string is "ravendb" and the default port is 161. 
You can change those with the following configuration keys:
<TabItem value="json" label="json">
<CodeBlock language="json">
{`\{
    ...
    "Monitoring.Snmp.Port": 12345,
    "Monitoring.Snmp.Community": "YourString"
    ...
\}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

The community string is used like a password. It is sent with each SNMP Get request and allows or denies access to the monitored device.

### The Metrics

It is usually easy to query the exposed metrics using a monitoring tool. ([Example](./setup-zabbix)).   
However, you should also be able to access those directly using any SNMP agent like [Net-SNMP](http://net-snmp.sourceforge.net/).   

The most basic SNMP commands are `snmpget`, `snmpset` and `snmptrapd`.  

Each metric has a unique identifier (OID) and can be accessed individually.   
For example, using the SNMP agent you could run the following snmpget command which gets the server up time metric:
<TabItem value="plain" label="plain">
<CodeBlock language="plain">
{`snmpget -v 2c -c ravendb live-test.ravendb.net 1.3.6.1.4.1.45751.1.1.1.1.1
snmpget -v 3 -l authNoPriv -u ravendb -a SHA -A ravendb live-test.ravendb.net 1.3.6.1.4.1.45751.1.1.1.2
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

Where **ravendb** is the community string (configured via `Monitoring.Snmp.Community` configuration option) and "live-test.ravendb.net" is the host.

For your convenience we've also added the list of metrics and their associated OIDs here:   

<Admonition type="note" title="Accessing a list of all available OIDs" id="accessing-a-list-of-all-available-oids" href="#accessing-a-list-of-all-available-oids">
You can list all OIDs along with its description using `{serverUrl}/monitoring/snmp/oids` endpoint.
</Admonition>

<Admonition type="note" title="Accessing OID value via HTTP" id="accessing-oid-value-via-http" href="#accessing-oid-value-via-http">
For convenience, single OID value can be retrieved via HTTP GET endpoint `{serverUrl}/monitoring/snmp?oid=<oid>`.

Example:
<TabItem value="bash" label="bash">
<CodeBlock language="bash">
{`curl -X GET http://live-test.ravendb.net/monitoring/snmp?oid=1.3.6.1.4.1.45751.1.1.1.3

\{"Value":"4.21:32:56.0700000"\}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

### Templates

For easier setup we have prepared a few templates for monitoring tools which can be found [here](https://github.com/ravendb/ravendb/tree/v4.0/src/Raven.Server/Monitoring/Snmp/Templates).   
These templates include the metrics and their associated OIDs.
