#Authentication & Authorization

RavenDB comes with a built-in authentication functionality and it supports two types of authentication:    
* [Windows Authentication](authentication/#windows-authentication)   
* [OAuth Authentication](authentication/#oauth-authentication)   

Appropriate authentication type is chosen by examining incoming request headers and by default all actions except read-only are being authenticated. To determine which actions will be authenticated please refer to [Raven/AnonymousAccess](../administration/configuration.mdx#authorization--authentication) configuration setting.

## Windows Authentication

When action (request) needs to be authenticated and no other authentication method is detected, then the Windows Authentication is chosen. Worth noting is that all `/admin` endpoint requests are processed using this method.

By default all windows users and groups have access to all the databases, but this can be easily changed by editing `Raven/Authorization/WindowsSettings` document in `system` database. The document consists of list of users and groups that contain the list of accessible databases. For example this document could look like this:

```json 
{
	"RequiredGroups": [],
	"RequiredUsers": [
	{
		"Name": "IIS AppPool\\DefaultAppPool",
		"Enabled": true,
		"Databases": [
		{
			"Admin": false,
			"TenantId": "ExampleDB",
			"ReadOnly": true
		}
		]
	}
	]
}
```

Above example gives a read-only access to `ExampleDB` to `IIS AppPool\DefaultAppPool`. Similar effect can be achieved using the Studio and editing `system` database settings.

## OAuth Authentication

Second supported authentication type is an [OAuth](https://oauth.net/) authentication and to simplify the process, we have introduced the API key authentication described below.

### Example - API keys

To authenticate the user by using API keys we need to create a document with `Raven/ApiKeys/key_name` as a key and `ApiKeyDefinition` as a content on `system` database.

<TabItem value="authentication_3" label="authentication_3">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`store.DatabaseCommands.Put("Raven/ApiKeys/sample",
						   null,
						   RavenJObject.FromObject(new ApiKeyDefinition
							   \{
								   Name = "sample",
								   Secret = "ThisIsMySecret",
								   Enabled = true,
								   Databases = new List<DatabaseAccess>
			                           \{
				                           new DatabaseAccess \{TenantId = "*"\},
				                           new DatabaseAccess \{TenantId = Constants.SystemDatabase\},
			                           \}
							   \}), new RavenJObject());
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

Now to perform any actions against specified database (`system` database must be declared explicitly), we need to provide the API key.

<TabItem value="authentication_4" label="authentication_4">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`var documentStore = new DocumentStore
	\{
		ApiKey = "sample/ThisIsMySecret",
		Url = "http://localhost:8080/"
	\};
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

## Debugging authentication issues

<Admonition type="note" title="">
This feature is available in RavenDB 2.0 build 2237 or higher.
</Admonition>

To grant the ability to resolve authentication issues, we have introduced `/debug/user-info` endpoint that will return information about current authenticated user and it can be accessed by executing the following code:

<TabItem value="authentication_5" label="authentication_5">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`var json = ((ServerClient) store.DatabaseCommands).CreateRequest("GET", "/debug/user-info").ReadResponseJson();
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

The returned results vary on the current authentication type:  
 
* **Anonymous**      

```json 
{
    "Remark": "Using anonymous user"
}
```

* **Windows Authentication** with full access to all databases:    

```json 
{
    "Remark": "Using windows auth",
	"User": "RavenUser",
	"IsAdmin": "True"
}
```

* **Windows Authentication** with restricted access:   

```json 
{
    "Remark": "Using windows auth",
	"User": "RavenUser",
	"IsAdmin": "False",
	"AdminDatabases": [],
    "ReadOnlyDatabases": [ "ExampleReadOnlyDB" ],
    "ReadWriteDatabases": [ "ExampleReadWriteDB" ]
}
```

* **OAuth Authentication**:    

```json 
{
    "Remark": "Using OAuth",
	"User": "RavenUser",
	"IsAdmin": "False",
	"TokenBody": "<token_here>"
}
```
