## Create Sample Data
---

Sample data can be generated on an empty database.

Creating sample data is quite useful since most of the examples in the documentation are based on this data,   
and it will help you become familiar with RavenDB and its various functionalities.

Click the 'Create' button to generate the Northwind database - documents and sample indexes will be created.
