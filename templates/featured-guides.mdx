# Featured guides

## Mark a guide as featured

Featured guides are rendered on the `/guides` home page using the
`FeaturedGuides` component.

Open `guides/home.mdx` and locate the `FeaturedGuides` usage:

````mdx
import FeaturedGuides from "@site/src/components/Guides/FeaturedGuides";

<FeaturedGuides guidesTitles={["Begin analysis with OLAP ETL", "Other Guide"]} />
````

### How it works

- The `recent-guides-plugin` collects all guides from the `guides` folder.
- `FeaturedGuides` looks up guides **by their `title` frontmatter**.
- The `guidesTitles` prop is an array of up to two titles that should be
  highlighted.

### Steps to feature a guide

1. **Create or edit the guide** in `guides` and set the `title` in frontmatter,
   for example:

   ```mdx
   ---
   title: "Example Guide"
   tags: [ai, demo]
   image: "/img/guides-ai-agents.webp"
   description: "Short description used in cards and lists."
   ---
   ```

2. **Update `guides/home.mdx`** and set the titles you want to feature:

   ````mdx
   <FeaturedGuides guidesTitles={["Example Guide", "Begin analysis with OLAP ETL"]} />
   ````

3. Make sure the strings in `guidesTitles` **exactly match** the `title`
   values in the guide frontmatter (including punctuation and casing).

4. Save and refresh the Guides home page – the cards in the **Featured guides**
   section will update automatically.

If you omit the `guidesTitles` prop, `FeaturedGuides` will fall back to showing
the two most recently updated guides based on file timestamps or `publishedAt`.
