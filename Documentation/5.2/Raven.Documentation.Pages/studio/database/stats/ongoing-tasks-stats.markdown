# Ongoing Tasks Stats View
---

{NOTE: }

* The Ongoing Tasks Stats View monitors ongoing _Replication_, _ETL_, 
  and _Data Subscription_ tasks and shows a graphical display of their 
  operations and performance.  
* A graph that summarizes activities related to all tasks is drawn 
  over the main timeline-ruler.  
* A task-specific timeline details operations and statistics related 
  to each ongoing task.  
* The main timeline can be selected in full or in part.  
  Task-specific timelines will display information collected 
  during the selected time period.  

* In this page:  
  * [Ongoing Tasks Stats View](../../../studio/database/stats/stats-overview#stats-view)  
  * [The Timeline](../../../studio/database/stats/stats-overview#the-timeline)
