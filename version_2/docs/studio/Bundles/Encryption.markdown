In here an auto-generated key is suggested to you, if you wish to enter a key for your own you can change it.  
Make sure you backup this key!  

In Addition you can set the encryption algorithm:

You can also choose if you want to encrypt the indexes as well (selected by default)


After you create the database, a window with the selected key will appear, this is your last chance to backup the key:
