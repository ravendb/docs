### Create embeddings to enable AI-powered similarity search.
    
* [Embeddings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedding_(machine_learning)) are numeric vectors that represent the meaning, context, or relationships within the data (e.g., text or images).
  They allow you to search for similar content using [Vector search](../../ai-integration/vector-search/start), rather than exact matches.
    
* RavenDB can generate embeddings automatically using [Embeddings-generation tasks](../../ai-integration/generating-embeddings/embeddings-generation-task) that you define.
  These tasks process text fields from documents and convert them into vectors using either an AI model from external providers 
  (e.g., [OpenAI](../../ai-integration/connection-strings/open-ai)) or [RavenDB’s built-in model](../../ai-integration/connection-strings/embedded).
  The resulting vectors are stored in a dedicated collection in your database.
    
* Alternatively, you can skip pre-generating embeddings via _Embedding-generation tasks_ and let RavenDB generate them on-the-fly during dynamic vector search queries.
  Learn more in [Vector search using a dynamic query](../../ai-integration/vector-search/vector-search-using-dynamic-query). 

* RavenDB does not generate embeddings for non-text content such as images.
  However, you can import embeddings for such content from external providers and store them in your database for similarity search.

* Embeddings also power other AI features in RavenDB, such as [GenAI](../../ai-integration/gen-ai-integration/start) and [AI agents](../../ai-integration/ai-agents/start),  
  which may use vector search queries to retrieve relevant documents in response to LLM requests.

### Use cases

Embeddings-generation tasks can prepare your data for AI-powered search, analysis, and retrieval.  
Common use cases include:  

* **Enterprise knowledge bases**  
  Generate embeddings for thousands of documents, policies, and procedures to enable fast, semantic search.
* **Legal document libraries**  
  Process case law, contracts, and regulations to build a searchable legal knowledge base.
* **Product catalogs**  
  Convert product descriptions, specifications, and reviews into embeddings for intelligent e-commerce search and recommendations.
* **Content management systems**  
  Transform blog posts, articles, and marketing materials into searchable vector embeddings.
