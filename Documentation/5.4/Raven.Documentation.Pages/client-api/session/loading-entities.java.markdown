# Session: Loading Entities
---

{NOTE: }

There are several methods with many overloads that allow users to download documents 
from the database and convert them to entities. This article will cover the following 
methods:  

- [Load](../../client-api/session/loading-entities#load)
- [Load with Includes](../../client-api/session/loading-entities#load-with-includes)
- [Load - multiple entities](../../client-api/session/loading-entities#load---multiple-entities)
- [LoadStartingWith](../../client-api/session/loading-entities#loadstartingwith)
- [ConditionalLoad](../../client-api/session/loading-entities#conditionalload)
- [Stream](../../client-api/session/loading-entities#stream)
- [IsLoaded](../../client-api/session/loading-entities#isloaded)

{PANEL:Load}

The most basic way to load a single entity is to use one of the `load` methods.

{CODE:java loading_entities_1_0@ClientApi\Session\LoadingEntities.java /}

| Parameters | | |
| ------------- | ------------- | ----- |
| **id** | `String` | Identifier of a document that will be loaded. |

| Return Value | |
| ------------- | ----- |
| T | Instance of `T` or `null` if a document with a given ID does not exist. |

### Example

{CODE:java loading_entities_1_1@ClientApi\Session\LoadingEntities.java /}

{NOTE From RavenDB version 4.x onwards, only string identifiers are supported. If you are upgrading from 3.x, this is a major change, because in 3.x non-string identifiers are supported. /}

{PANEL/}

{PANEL:Load with Includes}

When there is a 'relationship' between documents, those documents can be loaded in a 
single request call using the `include + load` methods. Learn more in 
[How To Handle Document Relationships](../../client-api/how-to/handle-document-relationships).  
See also [including counters](../../document-extensions/counters/counters-and-other-features#including-counters) 
and [including time series](../../document-extensions/timeseries/client-api/session/include/overview).

{CODE:java loading_entities_2_0@ClientApi\Session\LoadingEntities.java /}

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- | ----- |
| **path** | `String` | Path in documents in which the server should look for 'referenced' documents. |
| **ids** | `String` | Ids to load. |

| Return Type | Description |
| ------------- | ----- |
| `ILoaderWithInclude` | The `include` method by itself does not materialize any requests but returns loader containing methods such as `load`. |

### Example I

We can use this code to also load an employee which made the order.

{CODE:java loading_entities_2_1@ClientApi\Session\LoadingEntities.java /}

{PANEL/}

{PANEL:Load - multiple entities}

To load multiple entities at once, use one of the following `load` overloads.

{CODE:java loading_entities_3_0@ClientApi\Session\LoadingEntities.java /}

| Parameters | | |
| ------------- | ------------- | ----- |
| **ids** | Collection<String> or String... | Multiple document identifiers to load |

| Return Value | |
| ------------- | ----- |
| Map<String, T> | Instance of Map which maps document identifiers to `T` or `null` if a document with given ID doesn't exist. |

{CODE:java loading_entities_3_1@ClientApi\Session\LoadingEntities.java /}

{PANEL/}

{PANEL:LoadStartingWith}

To load multiple entities that contain a common prefix, use the `loadStartingWith` method from the `advanced` session operations.

{CODE:java loading_entities_4_0@ClientApi\Session\LoadingEntities.java /}

| Parameters | | |
| ------------- | ------------- | ----- |
| **idPrefix** | String |  prefix for which the documents should be returned  |
| **matches** | String | pipe ('&#124;') separated values for which document IDs (after 'idPrefix') should be matched ('?' any single character, '*' any characters) |
| **start** | int | number of documents that should be skipped  |
| **pageSize** | int | maximum number of documents that will be retrieved |
| **exclude** | String | pipe ('&#124;') separated values for which document IDs (after 'idPrefix') should **not** be matched ('?' any single character, '*' any characters) |
| **skipAfter** | String | skip document fetching until given ID is found and return documents after that ID (default: `null`) |

| Return Value | |
| ------------- | ----- |
| T[] | Array of entities matching given parameters. |

### Example I

{CODE:java loading_entities_4_1@ClientApi\Session\LoadingEntities.java /}

### Example II

{CODE:java loading_entities_4_2@ClientApi\Session\LoadingEntities.java /}

{PANEL: ConditionalLoad}

The `conditionalLoad` method takes a document's [change vector](../../server/clustering/replication/change-vector). 
If the entity is tracked by the session, this method returns the entity. If the entity 
is not tracked, it checks if the provided change vector matches the document's 
current change vector on the server side. If they match, the entity is not loaded. 
If the change vectors _do not_ match, the document is loaded.  

In other words, this method can be used to check whether a document has been modified 
since the last time its change vector was recorded, so that the cost of loading it 
can be saved if it has not been modified.  

The method is accessible from the `session.advanced()` operations.  

{CODE:java loading_entities_7_0@ClientApi\Session\LoadingEntities.java /}

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- | ----- |
| **clazz** | `Class<T>` | The class of a document to be loaded. |
| **id** | `String` | The identifier of a document to be loaded. |
| **changeVector** | `String` | The change vector you want to compare with the server-side change vector. If the change vectors match, the document is not loaded. |

| Return Type | Description |
| ------------- | ----- |
| ConditionalLoadResult<T>`(Class<T>, String ChangeVector)` | If the given change vector and the server side change vector do not match, the method returns the requested entity and its current change vector.<br/>If the change vectors match, the method returns `default` as the entity, and the current change vector.<br/>If the specified document, the method returns only `default` without a change vector. |

### Example

{CODE:java loading_entities_7_1@ClientApi\Session\LoadingEntities.java /}

{PANEL/}

{PANEL:Stream}

Entities can be streamed from the server using one of the following `stream` methods from the `advanced` session operations.

{CODE:java loading_entities_5_0@ClientApi\Session\LoadingEntities.java /}

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- | ----- |
| **startsWith** | `String` | prefix for which documents should be streamed |
| **matches** | `String` | pipe ('&#124;') separated values for which document IDs should be matched ('?' any single character, '*' any characters) |
| **start** | `int` | number of documents that should be skipped  |
| **pageSize** | `int` | maximum number of documents that will be retrieved |
| **skipAfter** | `String` | skip document fetching until a given ID is found and returns documents after that ID (default: `null`) |
| **streamQueryStats** | `Reference streamQueryStats (out parameter)` | Information about the streaming query (amount of results, which index was queried, etc.) |

| Return Value | |
| ------------- | ----- |
| CloseableIterator<StreamResult<T>> | Iterator with entities. |
| streamQueryStats (out parameter) | Information about the streaming query (amount of results, which index was queried, etc.) |


### Example I

Stream documents for a ID prefix:

{CODE:java loading_entities_5_1@ClientApi\Session\LoadingEntities.java /}

## Example 2

Fetch documents for a ID prefix directly into a stream:

{CODE:java loading_entities_5_2@ClientApi\Session\LoadingEntities.java /}

### Remarks

{INFO Entities loaded using `stream` will be transient (not attached to session). /}

{PANEL/}

{PANEL:IsLoaded}

To check if an entity is attached to a session, e.g. it has been loaded previously, use the `isLoaded` method from the `advanced` session operations.  
  
If you try to load a document that does not exist with the `load` method, `isLoaded` will return `true` because that document load has already been attempted.  

{CODE:java loading_entities_6_0@ClientApi\Session\LoadingEntities.java /}

| Parameters | | |
| ------------- | ------------- | ----- |
| **id** | `String` | Entity ID for which the check should be performed. |

| Return Value | |
| ------------- | ----- |
| boolean | Indicates if an entity with a given ID is loaded. |
