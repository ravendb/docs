## What are conflicts?
When two or more changes of a single document are done concurrently in two separate nodes, 
RavenDB cannot know which one of the changes is the correct one. This is called document conflict.  
For more information about conflicts and their resolution, see [article about conflicts](../../../server/clustering/replication/replication-conflicts.mdx).  

<Admonition type="note" title="">
By default, RavenDB will solve conflicts using "resolve to latest" strategy, thus the conflict will be resolved to a document with the latest 'modified date'.
</Admonition>
  
## When is a conflict exception thrown?
DocumentConflictException will be thrown for any access of a conflicted document.
Fetching attachments of a conflicted document will throw `InvalidOperationException` on the server.

## How can the conflict can be resolved from the client side?
 * PUT of a document with ID that belongs to conflicted document will resolve the conflict.

<TabItem value="PUT_Sample" label="PUT_Sample">
<CodeBlock language="java">
{`try (IDocumentSession session = store.openSession()) \{
    User user = new User();
    user.setName("John Doe");

    session.store(user, "users/123");
    // users/123 is a conflicted document
    session.saveChanges();
    // when this request is finished, the conflict for user/132 is resolved.
\}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

 * DELETE of a conflicted document will resolve its conflict.  

<TabItem value="DELETE_Sample" label="DELETE_Sample">
<CodeBlock language="java">
{`try (IDocumentSession session = store.openSession()) \{
    session.delete("users/123"); // users/123 is a conflicted document
    session.saveChanges(); //when this request is finished, the conflict for users/132 is resolved.
\}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

 * Incoming replication will resolve conflict if the incoming document has a larger [change vector](../../../server/clustering/change-vector.mdx).
