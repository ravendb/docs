* **Exploration Queries** form an additional layer of filtering that can be applied 
  to a dataset after its retrieval by [raw_rql](../../querying/overview.mdx#session-advanced-raw_query), 
  while the dataset is still held by the server.  

* The **retrieved dataset** is scanned and filtered **without requiring or creating an 
  index**, providing a way to conduct one-time explorations without creating an index that would 
  have to be maintained by the cluster.  

* You can filter the datasets retrieved by both **Index queries** and **Collection queries**.  

* Exploration queries need to be used 
  [with caution](../../indexes/querying/exploration-queries.mdx#when-should-exploration-queries-be-used) 
  since scanning and filtering all the data retrieved by a query cost substantial 
  [server resources and user waiting time](../../indexes/querying/exploration-queries.mdx#limit-the-query-and-prefer--for-recurring-queries) 
  when large datasets are handled.  
    <Admonition type="warning" title="">

    We recommend that you -  

    * [Limit](../../indexes/querying/exploration-queries.mdx#limit-the-query-and-prefer--for-recurring-queries) 
      the number of records that an exploration query filters.  
    * Use [where](../../indexes/querying/filtering.mdx) in recurring queries, 
      so the query would [use an index](../../indexes/querying/exploration-queries.mdx#limit-the-query-and-prefer--for-recurring-queries).

## `filter`

In Python, exploration queries can be applied via RQL using the `filter` keyword.  

The added filtering is parsed and executed by RavenDB's Javascript engine.  

The provided filtering operations resemble those implemented by 
[where](../../indexes/querying/filtering.mdx) and can be further enhanced 
by Javascript functions of your own.  
Read [here](../../indexes/querying/exploration-queries.mdx#with-user-defined-javascript-functions-) 
about creating and using your own Javascript function in your filters.  



## When should exploration queries be used

`filter` can be applied to a Collection query, like in:  
<TabItem value="sql" label="sql">
<CodeBlock language="sql">
{`from Employees as e 
filter e.Address.Country = 'USA'
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

it can also be applied to queries handled by an index, e.g. -  

<TabItem value="sql" label="sql">
<CodeBlock language="sql">
{`// in a dynamic query via an auto-index  
from Employees as e 
where e.Title = 'Sales Representative'  
filter e.Address.Country = 'USA'
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="sql" label="sql">
<CodeBlock language="sql">
{`// in a query that uses an index explicitly  
from index 'Orders/ByCompany' 
filter Count > 10
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

Both in a collection query and in a query handled by an index, the entire retrieved 
dataset is scanned and filtered.  
This helps understand when exploration queries should be used, why a Limit 
should be set for the number of filtered records, and when `where` should 
be preferred:  

<Admonition type="info" title="">
#### When to use
Use `filter` for an ad-hoc exploration of the retrieved dataset, that matches 
no existing index and is not expected to be repeated much.  

* You gain the ability to filter post-query results on the server side, for 
  both collection queries and when an index was used.  
* The dataset will be filtered without creating an unrequired index that the cluster 
  would continue updating from now on.  
</Admonition>
<Admonition type="warning" title="">
#### Limit the query, and prefer `where` for recurring queries 
Be aware that when a large dataset is retrieved, like the whole collection in 
the case of a collection query, exploring it all using `filter` would tax the server 
in memory and CPU usage while it checks the filter condition for each query result, 
and cost the user a substantial waiting time. Therefore -  

* **Limit** the number of records that an exploration query filters, e.g.:  
<TabItem value="sql" label="sql">
<CodeBlock language="sql">
{`from Employees as e 
filter e.Address.Country = 'USA'
filter_limit 500 // limit the number of filtered records
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
* Use [where](../../indexes/querying/filtering.mdx) rather than `filter` for recurring filtering.  
  `where` will use an index, creating it if necessary, to accelerate the filtering 
  in subsequent queries.  
</Admonition>



## Syntax

* In C#, for example, `filter` can be applied using code from the `Query` or `DocumentQuery`API.  
  There is no such API implementation under python, leaving `RQL` as the only way to perform exploration queries.

* **RQL**  
   * In an RQL query, use:  
     The `filter` keyword, followed by the filtering condition.  
     The `filter_limit` option, followed by the max number of records to filter.  
   * E.g. -  
<TabItem value="sql" label="sql">
<CodeBlock language="sql">
{`from Employees as e 
where e.Title = 'Sales Representative'  
filter e.Address.Country = 'USA' // filter the retrieved dataset
filter_limit 500 // limit the number of filter records
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>


## Usage examples

#### With collection queries

Use `filter` with a collection query to scan and filter the entire collection.  
<TabItem value="exploration-queries_1.3" label="exploration-queries_1.3">
<CodeBlock language="python">
{`result = session.advanced.raw_query(
    "from Employees as e " "filter e.Address.Country = 'USA' " "filter_limit 500", Employee
).single()
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

<Admonition type="warning" title="">
Filtering a sizable collection will burden the server and prolong user waiting time.  
Set a `filter_limit` to restrict the number of filtered records.  
</Admonition>
#### With queries that use an index

Use `filter` after a `where` clause to filter the results retrieved by an index query.  
<TabItem value="exploration-queries_2.3" label="exploration-queries_2.3">
<CodeBlock language="python">
{`emp = (
    session.advanced.raw_query(
        "from Employees as e "
        "where e.Title = $title "
        "filter e.Address.Country = $country "
        "filter_limit $limit",
        Employee,
    )
    .add_parameter("title", "Sales Representative")
    .add_parameter("country", "USA")
    .add_parameter("limit", 500)
    .single()
)
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
#### With projections

The filtered results can be projected using `select`, like those of any other query.  
<TabItem value="exploration-queries_3.3" label="exploration-queries_3.3">
<CodeBlock language="python">
{`emp3 = session.advanced.raw_query(
    "from Employees as e "
    "filter startsWith(e.FirstName, 'A') "
    "select \{ FullName: e.FirstName + ' ' + e.LastName \}",
    Employee,
)
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
#### With user-defined JavaScript functions (`declare`)

You can define a Javascript function as part of your query using the 
[declare](../../client-api/session/querying/what-is-rql.mdx#declare) keyword, and 
use it as part of your `filter` condition to freely adapt the filtering 
to your needs.  

Here is a simple example:  
<TabItem value="sql" label="sql">
<CodeBlock language="sql">
{`// declare a Javascript function
declare function titlePrefix(r, prefix) 
\{ 
    // Add whatever filtering capabilities you like
    return r.Title.startsWith(prefix)
\} 

from Employees as e 

// Filter using the function you've declared
filter titlePrefix(e, $prefix)
filter_limit 100
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
