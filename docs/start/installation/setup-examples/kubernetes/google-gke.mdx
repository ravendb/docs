# Installation: Kubernetes: Google GKE

In this walkthrough, we will set up a Kubernetes RavenDB cluster in GKE. The guide assumes prior knowledge of basic Kubernetes concepts. For more information please refer to the Kubernetes [official documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/).

## Setting Up the Environment

Follow the [Quickstart Guide](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/quickstart), and make sure you have `gcloud` and `Kubectl` installed.

Go to the project's IAM settings and add a role called "Kubernetes Engine Admin" to the member "XXXXXXX-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com" with the name "Compute Engine default service account" (or the equivalent member if the default name was changed).

In this guide, we create a 3-node Standard Cluster with the most basic default settings.

When the cluster is ready (can take a few minutes), run the following command to authenticate with it:

<TabItem value="something" label="bash">
<CodeBlock language="bash">
{`gcloud container clusters get-credentials ravendb-cluster
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

And create a cluster-admin role binding for the administrator.

<TabItem value="something" label="bash">
<CodeBlock language="bash">
{`kubectl create clusterrolebinding my-cluster-admin-binding --clusterrole cluster-admin --user $(gcloud config get-value account)
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

## Deploying secrets

For setting up a secured Kubernetes cluster, you must have your own domain and certificate. The RavenDB setup wizard with Let's Encrypt is not supported for this scenario.

There are a few ways you can get a certificate. One way is to purchase it from a well-known certificate authority. 

[Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) is a certificate authority which provides free certificates. 
There are many tools available online that automate the process of getting the certificate from Let's Encrypt. Two examples are [Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/) and a C# client called [Certes](https://github.com/fszlin/certes/).

RavenDB will accept PFX server certificates which contain the private key, are not expired, and have the following fields:

- KeyUsage: DigitalSignature, KeyEncipherment
- ExtendedKeyUsage: Client Authentication, Server Authentication

If you wish to use a self-signed certificate, you must register the CA certificate in the OS. A Docker image can be created based on the RavenDB image:

<TabItem value="something" label="bash">
<CodeBlock language="bash">
{`FROM ravendb/ravendb:latest
ADD my-ca.crt /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/my-ca.crt
RUN update-ca-certificates
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

In this guide, we are going to use a wildcard certificate for *.example.ravendb.cloud and a RavenDB developer license ([get a license here](https://ravendb.net/buy)).

You first need to convert the license and certificate files to base64. For example, in C# it can be done like this:

<TabItem value="something" label="bash">
<CodeBlock language="bash">
{`Convert.ToBase64String(File.ReadAllBytes("example.ravendb.cloud.pfx"))
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
Or in powershell:  
<TabItem value="something" label="bash">
<CodeBlock language="bash">
{`[Convert]::ToBase64String([IO.File]::ReadAllBytes("example.ravendb.cloud.pfx"))
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

Download [secrets.yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ravendb/docs/master/Documentation/4.1/Raven.Documentation.Pages/start/installation/setup-examples/Kubernetes/yamls/secrets.yaml) and edit it with the base64 values of the license and certificate. Then deploy it to the cluster.

<TabItem value="something" label="bash">
<CodeBlock language="bash">
{`kubectl create -f .\\secrets.yaml
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

## Deploying the HAProxy Ingress Controller

[Kubernetes ingress](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/) is a collection of routing rules which define how external users access services running in a Kubernetes cluster. 
In order for the Ingress resource to work, the cluster must have an [ingress controller](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress-controllers/) running. 
There are many third-party implementations and for this example, we chose to work with [HAProxy](https://github.com/jcmoraisjr/haproxy-ingress).

First, we need to label all of our cluster nodes: 

<TabItem value="something" label="bash">
<CodeBlock language="bash">
{`kubectl label node role=ingress-controller --all
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

Then we deploy the ingress controller with all of the necessary [RBAC (Role Based Access Control)](https://github.com/jcmoraisjr/haproxy-ingress/tree/master/examples/rbac) rules.

Download [haproxy.yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ravendb/docs/master/Documentation/4.1/Raven.Documentation.Pages/start/installation/setup-examples/Kubernetes/yamls/haproxy.yaml) and deploy it to the cluster:

<TabItem value="something" label="bash">
<CodeBlock language="bash">
{`kubectl create -f .\\haproxy.yaml
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

You may check that the command was executed by asking `Kubectl` to list all the pods and services in the default namespace. 
Take a look at the External-IP field. About a minute after deploying, you will receive a public IP for your cluster. 

<TabItem value="something" label="bash">
<CodeBlock language="bash">
{`kubectl get svc
kubectl get pod
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

## Deploying the RavenDB StatefulSet

Download [ravendb.yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ravendb/docs/master/Documentation/4.1/Raven.Documentation.Pages/start/installation/setup-examples/Kubernetes/yamls/gke/ravendb.yaml), edit the ConfigMap and Ingress objects with your personal domain information, and deploy it to the cluster:

<TabItem value="something" label="bash">
<CodeBlock language="bash">
{`kubectl create -f .\\ravendb.yaml
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

This will deploy the RavenDB [StatefulSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/) and the RavenDB pods will be created by order.

RavenDB should be deployed in a StatefulSet (and not in a Deployment or ReplicaSet) which guarantees the following: 

- Stable, unique network identifiers.  
- Stable, persistent storage.  
- Ordered, graceful deployment and scaling.  
- Ordered, automated rolling updates.  

To view the status of the cluster, run the following commands:

<TabItem value="something" label="bash">
<CodeBlock language="bash">
{`kubectl get pod
kubectl get svc
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

![3](./assets/container-creating.png)  

While the RavenDB pods are being created, you may already set DNS records. Go to your domain provider and create an "A Record" with the External-IP of the HAProxy service.

In our example, we create an "A Record" for *.example.ravendb.cloud and set the IP address to 35.192.132.78 and the TTL to 1 second.

![4](./assets/dns.png)  

Before trying to access the cluster, please register your wildcard *server* certificate in the OS (User Certificates Store). 
This will allow Chrome to recognize it and be able to use it to authenticate to the cluster. 
After the cluster is set up, you should use the RavenDB Studio to create a `ClusterAdmin` client certificate, and use it instead of the server certificate.

Open Chrome and go to https://a.example.ravendb.cloud, then use the Cluster View in the Studio to add the other nodes to the RavenDB cluster.

## Troubleshooting

If pods or services are not running or if they have errors you can issue a few commands that will help debug the problem.

The `logs` command displays the standard error of the pod. In case RavenDB threw a startup exception, it will be shown there.
<TabItem value="something" label="bash">
<CodeBlock language="bash">
{`kubectl logs ravendb-0
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

Running the `describe` command on any Kubernetes object (sts, svc, ingress, pod) will show details about the deployment of that object and in some cases relevant errors will be written there.
<TabItem value="something" label="bash">
<CodeBlock language="bash">
{`kubectl describe pod haproxy-ingress-5d4d8d95d8-5rtqh
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

If you need to restart a pod, simply delete it and it will terminate and then come back.
<TabItem value="something" label="bash">
<CodeBlock language="bash">
{`kubectl delete pod ravendb-2
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

If you delete the entire StatefulSet, the pods will be terminated by order of creation. 
<TabItem value="something" label="bash">
<CodeBlock language="bash">
{`kubectl delete sts ravendb
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
