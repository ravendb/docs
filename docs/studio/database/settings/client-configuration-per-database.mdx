# Client Configuration (for database)
<Admonition type="note" title="Note">

* You can override the [client-configuration](../../../studio/server/client-configuration.mdx) that is set server-wide __per database__:
  
 * From the Studio - as described in this article
 * From the Client API - see [put client-configuration operation](../../../client-api/operations/server-wide/configuration/put-serverwide-client-configuration.mdx#put-client-configuration-(server-wide))

* Setting the client-configuration from the studio sets the configuration on the RavenDB server.  
  This enables administrators to dynamically control the client behavior even after it has started running.  
  e.g. manage load balancing of client requests on the fly in response to changing system demands.

## Set the client-configuration (for database)

![Figure 1. Client Configuration Per Database](./assets/client-configuration-database-1.png)


**1. Identity parts separator**  

  * Changes the default **separator** for automatically generated document IDs.  
    You can use any `char` except `|` (pipe).  
    Default value: `/`  

**2. Max number of requests per session**  

  * Set this number to restrict the number of requests (***Reads*** & ***Writes***) per session in the client API.  
    Default value: 30  

**3. Use Session Context for Load Balancing**  

  * Allow client sessions to select their topology by tag, 
    so they'd be able to load-balance their requests.  
  
  * Optionally, select a hash seed to randomize the topology that clients would use.

  * For a detailed explanation see: [Load Balance Behavior](../../../client-api/configuration/load-balance/load-balance-behavior.mdx).

**4. Read balance behavior**  

  * Set the load-balance method that the client will use when accessing a node with ***Read*** requests.  
    The method selected will also affect the client's decision of which node to failover to in case of issues with the ***Read*** request.  
    Note: ***Write*** requests will always access the [preferred node](../../../client-api/configuration/load-balance/overview.mdx#the-preferred-node) calculated by the client.  

  * Available options are:  
     * _None_  
     * _Round Robin_  
     * _Fastest Node_  

  * For a detailed explanation see: [Read Balance Behavior](../../../client-api/configuration/load-balance/read-balance-behavior.mdx).  



<Admonition type="info" title="Note" id="note" href="#note">

This view will be as in the above image when the general server [Client Configuration](../../../studio/server/client-configuration.mdx) is not yet defined.  
If a general server client-configuration is defined then this view will show the __effective configuration__ for the specific database.
