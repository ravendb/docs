# Ongoing Tasks: Queue ETL Overview
<Admonition type="note" title="">

* Message brokers are high-throughput, distributed messaging services that 
  host data they receive from **producer** applications and serve it to 
  **consumer** clients via FIFO data queue/s. 
* RavenDB 5.4 and on can function as a _Producer_ in this architecture.  
  RavenDB 6.0 and on can also function as a _Consumer_.  
  <Admonition type="info" title="">
  This overview and the other pages in the Queue ETL section explain 
  **only** RavenDB's role as a _Producer_ through the execution of ETL tasks.  
  To learn about RavenDB's role as a _Consumer_ please refer to the 
  [Queue Sink section](../../../../server/ongoing-tasks/queue-sink/overview.mdx).  
  </Admonition>
* RavenDB produces messages to broker queues via ETL tasks that -  
   * Extract data from specified document collections.  
   * Transform the data to new JSON objects.  
   * Load the JSON objects to the message broker.  
* Prior to loading the JSON objects to the designated broker, RavenDB wraps 
  them as CloudEvents messages using the [CloudEvents Library](https://cloudevents.io).  
* Supported message brokers currently include **Apache Kafka** and **RabbitMQ**.  

* In this page:  
   * [Supported Message Brokers](../../../../server/ongoing-tasks/etl/queue-etl/overview.mdx#supported-message-brokers)  
   * [CloudEvents](../../../../server/ongoing-tasks/etl/queue-etl/overview.mdx#cloudevents)

## Supported Message Brokers

Queue brokers that RavenDB can currently read data from include **Apache Kafka** and **RabbitMQ**.

2. **RabbitMQ ETL**  
   Click to define a RabbitMQ ETL task.  



## CloudEvents

After preparing a JSON object that needs to be sent to a message broker, 
the ETL task wraps it as a CloudEvents message using the [CloudEvents Library](https://cloudevents.io).  

To do that, the JSON object is provided with additional 
[required attributes](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/main/cloudevents/spec.md#required-attributes), 
added as headers to the message, including:  

| Attribute | Type | Description | Default Value |
|:-------------|:-------------|:-------------:|:-------------|
| **Id** | `string` | [Event Identifier](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/main/cloudevents/spec.md#id) | Document **Change Vector** |
| **Type** | `string` | [Event Type](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/main/cloudevents/spec.md#type) | **"ravendb.etl.put"** |
| **Source** | `string` | [Event Context](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/main/cloudevents/spec.md#source-1) | `<ravendb-node-url>/<database-name>/<etl-task-name>` |
#### Optional Attributes

The optional **partitionkey** attribute can also be added. 
It is currently only implemented by [Kafka](../../../../server/ongoing-tasks/etl/queue-etl/kafka.mdx).  

| Optional Attribute | Type | Description | Default Value |
|:-------------|:-------------|:-------------:|:-------------|
| **partitionkey** | `string` | [events relationship/grouping definition](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/main/cloudevents/extensions/partitioning.md#partitionkey) | **Document ID** |



## Task Statistics

Use Studio's [ongoing tasks stats](../../../../studio/database/stats/ongoing-tasks-stats/overview.mdx) view 
to see various statistics related to data extraction, transformation, and loading to the target broker.
