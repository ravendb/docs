* Use `timeSeriesFor.delete` to delete time series entries.  
* A time series is removed when all of its entries are deleted.  

* In this page:  
    * [usage](../../../../../document-extensions/timeseries/client-api/session/delete.mdx#usage)
    * [Example](../../../../../document-extensions/timeseries/client-api/session/delete.mdx#example)
  
</Admonition>
## usage

**Flow**:

* Open a session.  
* Create an instance of `timeSeriesFor` and pass it the following:
    * Provide an explicit document ID, or -   
      pass an [entity tracked by the session](../../../../../client-api/session/what-is-a-session-and-how-does-it-work.mdx#unit-of-work-pattern),
      e.g. a document object returned from [session.query](../../../../../client-api/session/querying/how-to-query.mdx) 
      or from [session.load](../../../../../client-api/session/loading-entities.mdx#load).
    * Specify the time series name.
* Call `timeSeriesFor.delete` and provide the **timestamps range** of the entries you want to delete.  
* Call `session.SaveChanges` for the action to take effect on the server.  

**Note**:

* If the specified document doesn't exist, a `DocumentDoesNotExistException` will be thrown.  
* Attempting to delete nonexistent entries results in a no-op and generates no exception.  
* To delete a whole time series simply delete all its entries.  
  The series is removed when all its entries are deleted.  
* Deleting a document deletes all its time series as well.  



## Example

In the following example we delete a time series entry appended by sample code in the 
[append](../../../../../document-extensions/timeseries/client-api/session/append.mdx#examples) article.  
<TabItem value="timeseries_region_Delete-TimeSeriesFor-Single-Time-Point" label="timeseries_region_Delete-TimeSeriesFor-Single-Time-Point">
<CodeBlock language="php">
{`// Delete a single entry
$session = $store->openSession();
try \{
    $session->timeSeriesFor("users/john", "HeartRates")
    ->delete((clone $baseTime)->add(new DateInterval("PT1M")));

    $session->saveChanges();
\} finally \{
    $session->close();
\}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
