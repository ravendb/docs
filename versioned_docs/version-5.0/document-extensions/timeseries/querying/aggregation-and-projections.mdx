# Querying: Aggregating and Projecting Time Series
<Admonition type="note" title="">

* **Aggregation**  
  Queries can easily create powerful statistics by aggregating time series 
  into groups by chosen time frames like an hour or a week, and retrieving 
  values from each group by criteria like `Min` for the lowest value, 
  `Count` for the number of values in the group, etc.  
  
* **Projection** by criteria  
  Queries can explicitly select the criteria by which values would be retrieved 
  and projected to the client.  
  When a query does **not** select specific criteria, RavenDB will consider it 
  an implicit selection of **all** criteria and project to the client the values 
  from each group, that match each criterion.  

    <Admonition type="info" title="Projecting values from Aggregated and Non-Aggregated result-sets" id="projecting-values-from-aggregated-and-non-aggregated-result-sets" href="#projecting-values-from-aggregated-and-non-aggregated-result-sets">

    * When values are selected from a time series (or a range of time series 
     entries) that **has** been aggregated, they are selected per-group.  
    * When values are selected from a series or a range that **hasn't** 
      been aggregated, they are selected from the entire result-set.

## Aggregation and Projection

In an RQL query, use the `group by` expression to aggregate 
time series (or ranges of time series entries) in groups by 
a chosen resolution, and the `select` keyword to choose and 
project entries by a chosen criteria.    

<Admonition type="info" title="You can aggregate entries by these time units:" id="you-can-aggregate-entries-by-these-time-units" href="#you-can-aggregate-entries-by-these-time-units">  

* **Milliseconds**

## Query Examples

* In this sample, we group entries of users' HeartRates time series 
  and project the lowest and highest values of each group.  
  Each HeartRates entry holds a single value.
<TabItem value="json" label="json">
<CodeBlock language="json">
{`from Employees as e
select timeseries(
    from HeartRates between 
        '2020-05-17T00:00:00.0000000Z' 
        and '2020-05-23T00:00:00.0000000Z'
    where Tag == 'watches/fitbit'
    group by '1 days'
    select min(), max()
)
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
   * **group by '1 days'**  
     We group each user's HeartRates time series entries in consecutive 1-day groups.  
   * **select min(), max()**  
     We select the lowest and highest values of each group and project them to the client.  

* In this sample, we group entries of companies' StockPrice time series 
  in consecutive 7-day groups and project the highest and lowest values 
  of each group.  
  Each StockPrice entry holds five values, the query returns the `Max` 
  and `Min` values of each:  
  Values[0] - **Open** - stock price when the trade opens  
  Values[1] - **Close** - stock price when the trade ends  
  Values[2] - **High** - highest stock price during trade time  
  Values[3] - **Low** - lowest stock price during trade time  
  Values[4] - **Volume** - overall trade volume  
<TabItem value="json" label="json">
<CodeBlock language="json">
{`declare timeseries SP(c) 
\{
    from c.StockPrice 
    where Values[4] > 500000
        group by '7 day'
        select max(), min()
\}
from Companies as c
where c.Address.Country = 'USA'
select c.Name, SP(c)
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
   * **where Values[4] &gt; 500000**  
     Query stock price behavior when the trade volume is high.  
   * **group by '7 day'**  
     Group each company's StockPrice entries in consecutive 7-day groups.  
   * **select max(), min()**  
     Select the highest (`Max`) and lowest (`Min`) 
     values of each group and project them to the client.  
     Since each entry holds 5 values, the query will project 
     5 `Max` values for each group (the highest Values[0], highest 
     Values[1], etc.) and 5 `Min` values for each group (the lowest 
     Values[0], lowest Values[1], etc.).  
   * **select c.Name, SP(c)**  
     Project the company's name along with the time series query 
     results to make the results easier to read and understand.  

* This sample is similar to the one above it, except that time series 
  entries are **not aggregated**, so the highest and lowest values are 
  collected not from each group but from the entire result-set.  
<TabItem value="json" label="json">
<CodeBlock language="json">
{`declare timeseries SP(c) 
\{
    from c.StockPrice 
    where Values[4] > 500000
        select max(), min()
\}
from Companies as c
where c.Address.Country = 'USA'
select c.Name, SP(c)
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
   * **select max(), min()**  
     Since there is no aggregation, the entire result-set is queried 
     and the results include only the all-time highest and lowest Open, 
     Close, High, Low and Volume values.  



## Client Usage Samples

<Admonition type="info" title="">
You can run queries from your client using raw RQL and LINQ.  

* Learn how to run a LINQ time series query [here](../../../document-extensions/timeseries/client-api/session/querying.mdx#time-series-linq-queries).  
* Learn how to run a raw RQL time series query [here](../../../document-extensions/timeseries/client-api/session/querying.mdx#client-raw-rql-queries).  

</Admonition>

To aggregate time series entries, use `GroupBy()` in a LINQ query 
or `group by` in a raw RQL query.  
To select time series values for projection, use `Select()` in a LINQ query 
or `select` in a raw RQL query.  

* Here we express the query we've discussed above using 
  LINQ and both RQL syntaxes.  
<Tabs groupId='languageSyntax'>
<TabItem value="LINQ" label="LINQ">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`IRavenQueryable<TimeSeriesAggregationResult> query = session.Query<Company>()
