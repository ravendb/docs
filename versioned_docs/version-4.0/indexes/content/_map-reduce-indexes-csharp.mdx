Map-Reduce indexes allow you to perform complex aggregations of data. The first stage, called the map, runs over documents and extracts portions of data according to the defined mapping function(s).
Upon completion of the first phase, reduction is applied to the map results and the final outcome is produced.

The idea behind map-reduce indexing is that aggregation queries using such indexes are very cheap. The aggregation is performed only once and the results are stored inside the index.
Once new data comes into the database or existing documents are modified, the map-reduce index will keep the aggregation results up-to-date. The aggregations are never done during
querying to avoid expensive calculations that could result in severe performance degradation. When you make the query, RavenDB immediately returns the matching results directly from the index.

For a more in-depth look at how map reduce works, you can read this post: [RavenDB 4.0 Unsung Heroes: Map/reduce](https://ayende.com/blog/179938/ravendb-4-0-unsung-heroes-map-reduce).

## Creating

When it comes to index creation, the only difference between simple indexes and the map-reduce ones is an additional reduce function defined in index definition. 
To deploy an index we need to create a definition and deploy it using one of the ways described in the [creating and deploying](../../indexes/creating-and-deploying.mdx) article.

### Example I - Count

Let's assume that we want to count the number of products for each category. To do it, we can create the following index using `LoadDocument` inside:

<TabItem value="map_reduce_0_0" label="map_reduce_0_0">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`public class Products_ByCategory : AbstractIndexCreationTask<Product, Products_ByCategory.Result>
\{
    public class Result
    \{
        public string Category \{ get; set; \}

        public int Count \{ get; set; \}
    \}

    public Products_ByCategory()
    \{
        Map = products => from product in products
                          let categoryName = LoadDocument<Category>(product.Category).Name
                          select new
                          \{
                              Category = categoryName,
                              Count = 1
                          \};

        Reduce = results => from result in results
                            group result by result.Category into g
                            select new
                            \{
                                Category = g.Key,
                                Count = g.Sum(x => x.Count)
                            \};
    \}
\}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

and issue the query:

<Tabs groupId='languageSyntax'>
<TabItem value="Query" label="Query">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`IList<Products_ByCategory.Result> results = session
    .Query<Products_ByCategory.Result, Products_ByCategory>()
    .Where(x => x.Category == "Seafood")
    .ToList();
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="DocumentQuery" label="DocumentQuery">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`IList<Products_ByCategory.Result> results = session
    .Advanced
    .DocumentQuery<Products_ByCategory.Result, Products_ByCategory>()
    .WhereEquals(x => x.Category, "Seafood")
    .ToList();
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="RQL" label="RQL">
<CodeBlock language="sql">
{`from 'Products/ByCategory'
where Category == 'Seafood'
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The above query will return one result for _Seafood_ with the appropriate number of products from that category.

### Example II - Average

In this example, we will count an average product price for each category. The index definition:

<TabItem value="map_reduce_1_0" label="map_reduce_1_0">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`public class Products_Average_ByCategory :
    AbstractIndexCreationTask<Product, Products_Average_ByCategory.Result>
\{
    public class Result
    \{
        public string Category \{ get; set; \}

        public decimal PriceSum \{ get; set; \}

        public double PriceAverage \{ get; set; \}

        public int ProductCount \{ get; set; \}
    \}

    public Products_Average_ByCategory()
    \{
        Map = products => from product in products
                          let categoryName = LoadDocument<Category>(product.Category).Name
                          select new
                          \{
                              Category = categoryName,
                              PriceSum = product.PricePerUnit,
                              PriceAverage = 0,
                              ProductCount = 1
                          \};

        Reduce = results => from result in results
                            group result by result.Category into g
                            let productCount = g.Sum(x => x.ProductCount)
                            let priceSum = g.Sum(x => x.PriceSum)
                            select new
                            \{
                                Category = g.Key,
                                PriceSum = priceSum,
                                PriceAverage = priceSum / productCount,
                                ProductCount = productCount
                            \};
    \}
\}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

and the query:

<Tabs groupId='languageSyntax'>
<TabItem value="Query" label="Query">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`IList<Products_Average_ByCategory.Result> results = session
    .Query<Products_Average_ByCategory.Result, Products_Average_ByCategory>()
    .Where(x => x.Category == "Seafood")
    .ToList();
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="DocumentQuery" label="DocumentQuery">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`IList<Products_Average_ByCategory.Result> results = session
    .Advanced
    .DocumentQuery<Products_Average_ByCategory.Result, Products_Average_ByCategory>()
    .WhereEquals(x => x.Category, "Seafood")
    .ToList();
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="RQL" label="RQL">
<CodeBlock language="sql">
{`from 'Products/Average/ByCategory'
where Category == 'Seafood'
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Example III - Calculations

This example illustrates how we can put some calculations inside an index using on one of the indexes available in the sample database (`Product/Sales`).

We want to know how many times each product was ordered and how much we earned for it. In order to extract that information, we need to define the following index:

<TabItem value="map_reduce_2_0" label="map_reduce_2_0">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`public class Product_Sales : AbstractIndexCreationTask<Order, Product_Sales.Result>
\{
    public class Result
    \{
        public string Product \{ get; set; \}

        public int Count \{ get; set; \}

        public decimal Total \{ get; set; \}
    \}

    public Product_Sales()
    \{
        Map = orders => from order in orders
                        from line in order.Lines
                        select new
                        \{
                            Product = line.Product,
                            Count = 1,
                            Total = ((line.Quantity * line.PricePerUnit) * (1 - line.Discount))
                        \};

        Reduce = results => from result in results
                            group result by result.Product into g
                            select new
                            \{
                                Product = g.Key,
                                Count = g.Sum(x => x.Count),
                                Total = g.Sum(x => x.Total)
                            \};
    \}
\}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

and send the query:

<Tabs groupId='languageSyntax'>
<TabItem value="Query" label="Query">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`IList<Product_Sales.Result> results = session
    .Query<Product_Sales.Result, Product_Sales>()
    .ToList();
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="DocumentQuery" label="DocumentQuery">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`IList<Product_Sales.Result> results = session
    .Advanced
    .DocumentQuery<Product_Sales.Result, Product_Sales>()
    .ToList();
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="RQL" label="RQL">
<CodeBlock language="sql">
{`from 'Product/Sales'
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>



## Reduce Results as Artificial Documents

In addition to storing the aggregation results in the index, the map-reduce indexes can also output reduce results as documents to a specified collection.
In order to create such documents, called _artificial_, you need to define the target collection using the `OutputReduceToCollection` property in the index definition.

<TabItem value="map_reduce_3_0" label="map_reduce_3_0">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`public class ProductSales_ByDate : AbstractIndexCreationTask<Order, DailyProductSale>
\{
    public ProductSales_ByDate()
    \{
        Map = orders => from order in orders
                        from line in order.Lines
                        select new DailyProductSale
                        \{
                            Product = line.Product,
                            Date = new DateTime(order.OrderedAt.Year,
                                                order.OrderedAt.Month,
                                                order.OrderedAt.Day),
                            Count = 1,
                            Total = ((line.Quantity * line.PricePerUnit) * (1 - line.Discount))
                        \};

        Reduce = results => from result in results
                            group result by new \{ result.Product, result.Date \} into g
                            select new DailyProductSale
                            \{
                                Product = g.Key.Product,
                                Date = g.Key.Date,
                                Count = g.Sum(x => x.Count),
                                Total = g.Sum(x => x.Total)
                            \};

        OutputReduceToCollection = "DailyProductSales";
        PatternReferencesCollectionName = "DailyProductSales/References";
        PatternForOutputReduceToCollectionReferences = x => $"sales/daily/\{x.Date:yyyy-MM-dd\}";
    \}
\}

public class DailyProductSale
\{
    public string Product \{ get; set; \}
    public DateTime Date \{ get; set; \}
    public int Count \{ get; set; \}
    public decimal Total \{ get; set; \}
\}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

Writing map-reduce outputs into documents allows you to define additional indexes on top of them that give you the option to create recursive map-reduce operations.
This way, you can do daily/monthly/yearly summaries very cheaply and easy. 

In addition, you can also apply the usual operations on documents (e.g. data subscriptions or ETL).

<Admonition type="info" title="Saving documents" id="saving-documents" href="#saving-documents">

Artificial documents are stored immediately after the indexing transaction completes.

</Admonition>

<Admonition type="warning" title="Recursive indexing loop" id="recursive-indexing-loop" href="#recursive-indexing-loop">
It is forbidden to output reduce results to a collection when:  

- It is a collection that the current index is already working on  
  (e.g. index on `DailyInvoices` collections outputs to `DailyInvoices`)
- It is a collection that the current index is loading a document from  
  (e.g. index has `LoadDocument(id, "Invoices")` outputs to `Invoices`)
- it is a collection that is processed by another map-reduce index, that 
  outputs results to a collection that the current index is working on  
  (e.g. one index indexes the `Invoices` collection and outputs to the 
  `DailyInvoices` collection, and a second index indexes the `DailyInvoices` 
  collection and outputs to the `Invoices` collection)

The reason these scenarios are forbidden is that they result in infinite 
indexing loop. Attempting to create such indexes will produce a detailed error.  
</Admonition>

<Admonition type="warning" title="Output to an Existing collection" id="output-to-an-existing-collection" href="#output-to-an-existing-collection">
Creating a map-reduce index which defines an output collection that already 
exists and contains documents, will result in an error. Please delete all documents
from the target collection before creating the index or output the results to 
a different collection.  
</Admonition>

<Admonition type="warning" title="Modification of Artificial Documents" id="modification-of-artificial-documents" href="#modification-of-artificial-documents">
Artificial documents can be loaded and queried just like regular documents.  
However, it is **not** recommended to edit artificial documents manually since 
any index results update would overwrite all manual modifications made in them.  
</Admonition>

### Artificial Document IDs

The identifiers of artificial documents are generated as:

- `<OutputCollectionName>/<hash-of-reduce-key>`

For the above sample index, the document ID can be:

- `MonthlyProductSales/13770576973199715021`

The numeric part is the hash of the reduce key values, in this case: `hash(Product, Month)`.

If the aggregation value for a given reduce key changes then we overwrite the artificial document. It will get removed once there is no result for a given reduce key.
    
### Artificial Document Flags

Documents generated by map-reduce indexes get the following `@flags` metadata:

<TabItem value="json" label="json">
<CodeBlock language="json">
{`"@flags": "Artificial, FromIndex"
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

Those flags are used internally by the database to filter out artificial documents during replication.
