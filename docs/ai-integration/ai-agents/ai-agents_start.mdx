# AI Agents: Start

AI agents are built to easily integrate AI capabilities into RavenDB clients.  
An AI agent serves as a client's proxy to an AI model; the agent can not only maintain a continuous conversation with the model but also enable it to securely query a RavenDB database and request the client to perform actions.  
Using AI agents frees developers from the need to manage an AI model in their code, enhances the model by giving it access to a credible and relevant data source, and opens the door to numerous operational scenarios.  

## Use cases

Creating an AI agent and assigning it a role can be done in minutes using Studio or the API, making it easy to address a wide variety of use cases like -    

- [Customer support chatbot agents](../../ai-integration/ai-agents/ai-agents_overview#customer-support-chatbot-agents)  
- [Data analysis and reporting agents](../../ai-integration/ai-agents/ai-agents_overview#data-analysis-and-reporting-agents)  
- [Automated content generation agents](../../ai-integration/ai-agents/ai-agents_overview#automated-content-generation-agents)  
- [Workflow automation agents](../../ai-integration/ai-agents/ai-agents_overview#workflow-automation-agents)  
- [Intelligent recommendation agents](../../ai-integration/ai-agents/ai-agents_overview#intelligent-recommendation-agents)  


## Technical documentation
