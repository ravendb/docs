### ReadBalanceBehavior

* This convention gets or sets the default load-balancing behavior of ***Read*** requests from the client to RavenDB cluster.  

* The method selected in the convention determines which node the client's `RequestExecutor` will send the ***Read*** requests to,  
  and which node to *failover* to in case of issues with the ***Read*** request.  

* Note: ***Write*** requests will always access the [Preferred Node](../../client-api/configuration/load-balance-and-failover.mdx#preferred-node) calculated by the client.

## ReadBalanceBehavior Options

  * `NONE`  
    * **Load-balance**: No load balancing will occur. The client will always select the _preferred node_.  
    * **Failover**: The client will failover nodes in the order they appear in the _topology nodes list_.  
      Note: The list can be reordered, see [Database Group Actions](../../studio/database/settings/manage-database-group.mdx#database-group-topology---actions).  

  * `ROUND_ROBIN`  
    * **Load-balance**: For each _Read_ request, the client will address the next node from the _topology nodes list_.  
    * **Failover**: In case of a failure, the client will try the next node in the round robin order. 

  * `FASTEST_NODE`  
    * **Load-balance**: _Read_ request will go to the fastest node.  
      The fastest node is determined by a [Speed Test](../../client-api/cluster/speed-test.mdx).  
    * **Failover**: In case of a failure, a speed test will be triggered again and in the meantime the client will use the _preferred node_.  


## Preferred Node

* The preferred node is selected by simply going over the _topology nodes list_ and returning the first node that has not had any errors.  

* If all nodes are in a failure state then the _first_ node in the list is returned. The user would get an error or recover if the error was transient.  


## Session Usage

* When using `ROUND_ROBIN` or `FASTEST_NODE` it might happen that the next [session](../../client-api/session/opening-a-session.mdx) you open will access a different node.  

* A short delay in replicating changes to all nodes in the cluster is acceptable in most cases.  
  If you need to ensure that the next request will be able to _immediately_ read what you just wrote, 
  you need to use [write assurance](../../client-api/session/saving-changes.mdx#waiting-for-replication---write-assurance).
