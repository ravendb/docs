# Plugins: What are plugins?

Under the `Raven.Database.Plugins` namespace, various interfaces and classes that might be used to extend the database behavior can be found.

All DLL's containing custom plugins must be placed in `Plugins` directory that by default is found in `~\Plugins`. To change the default location of this directory, please refer to [this](../../server/configuration/configuration-options.mdx#bundles) page.
