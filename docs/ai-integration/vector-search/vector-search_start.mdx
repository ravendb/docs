# Vector search: Start
Vector search operations allow you to compare [Embeddings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedding_(machine_learning)) to find content by proximity rather than by exact matches, e.g. to find text by meaning or image by context.  
You can search over embeddings that were generated by RavenDB [ongoing embeddings-generation tasks](../../ai-integration/generating-embeddings/embeddings-generation-task) or by an external embeddings provider, or generate the embeddings for your documents on-the-fly while searching.  
- When you run a vector search, your search query is converted into an embedding as well, and can be compared against document embeddings using either a dynamic query for ad-hoc or infrequent searches or a static index for optimized performance.  
- Vector search can be used by other RavenDB AI features. For example, [GenAI tasks](../../ai-integration/gen-ai-integration/gen-ai_start) can use vector search to find documents and update them with LLM-generated content, or [AI agents](../../ai-integration/ai-agents/ai-agents_start) can use vector search to retrieve relevant data requested by the LLM.
