   * ***Disabled*** - the database has been disabled.  
  
   * Note:  
     If the database is contained in a cluster's node that is different than the node that is currently viewed in this Studio instance, then 'Remote' will be indicated - see more [below](../../studio/database/databases-list-view#remote-database).

{PANEL: Remote Database}

![Figure 5. Remote Database](images/database-actions-4.png "Remote Database")

* If the database is contained in one of the cluster's other nodes, but not in the node you are currently viewing in this instance of the studio,  
  the database state will be ***'Remote'***

* For example, in the above figure, DB2 is contained in nodes A & B. 
  DB2 is labeled ***'Remote'*** because we are currently viewing node C.  

* **Note:** Clicking on a remote database will navigate to the documents view for this database on one of its containing nodes.
