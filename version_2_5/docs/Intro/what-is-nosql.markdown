## What is NoSQL?

NoSQL refers to a set of technologies designed to store data in a non-relational manner.

At the time of this writing, a vast majority of applications store data in a relational database.  NoSQL aims to offer alternatives to RDBMS.  There are many types of data which fit better in non-relational data mode.

### Classes of NoSQL Solutions

Most NoSQL solutions store data using one of the following paradigms:

* Document Database
* Key-Value store
* Graph Database

While in theory, any solution can be used to store any data, certain solutions are better suited to certain types of data.

RavenDB is a powerful and scalable document database.
