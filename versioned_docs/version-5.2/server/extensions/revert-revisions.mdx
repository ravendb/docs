# Revert Revisions

Allow to revert the database to a specific point in time.

<Admonition type="info" title="">

This feature is available only if [Revisions](../../server/extensions/revisions.mdx) are enabled.

</Admonition>

You can find this option under the `Document Revisions` in the studio:

Clicking on `Revert Revision` will open the the following window:

![Figure 2.](./assets/revert-revisions-2.png)

| Name   |      Description      |  Value Type |
|----------|-------------|------|
| `Point in Time` |  Roll back all of the documents to the version at the specified time. | `DateTime` |
| `Window` |    Window parameter is used for performance optimization: since revisions are not sorted by date, we stop the revert process when hitting a versioned document outside the window.  |   `long` (default: 96 * 3,600) |



For example when reverting to the point in time of `16/03/2019 09:55 UTC` the following rules are applied:

* Documents modified after `16/03/2019 09:55 UTC` will be reverted (by creating new revision) to latest version before `16/03/2019 09:55 UTC`.
* If collection has maximum revisions limit and all of them were created after `16/03/2019 09:55 UTC` the oldest revision will be used.
* Documents created after `16/03/2019 09:55 UTC` will be deleted and moved to Revisions Bin.
* Remaining documents will not be modified.
