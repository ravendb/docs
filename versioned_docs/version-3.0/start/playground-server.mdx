# Getting started: Playground Server

Live-test server offers a full functionality of a RavenDB server and is available at [live-test.ravendb.net](http://live-test.ravendb.net/). We encourage you to check it out and test various functionalities.

<Admonition type="info" title="Information" id="information" href="#information">

- server accepts remote connectivity, so you can build your applications locally for testing purposes and specify its address - `http://live-test.ravendb.net/` (more [here](../client-api/creating-document-store.mdx))
- sample database can be deployed as in any normal instance (more [here](../studio/overview/tasks/create-sample-data.mdx))

</Admonition>

<Admonition type="warning" title="Important" id="important" href="#important">

- all databases available at `live-test.ravendb.net` server are publicly available and can be accessed, managed and copied by any user.

## LINQPad

Driver for [LINQPad](https://www.linqpad.net/) that supports RavenDB connectivity was created by Ronnie Overby. It can be downloaded from project [GitHub page](https://github.com/ronnieoverby/RavenDB-Linqpad-Driver) (compiling the solution will overwrite the installed driver) or installed directly through LINQPad.

### Installation

Step 1. Click on `Add Connection` in LINQPad.

Step 2. In `Choose Data Context` view click on `View more drivers...`.

![Figure 2. Getting started. Playground Server. LINQPad. Installation. Step 2.](./assets/linqpad-2.png)  

Step 3. In `Choose a Driver` view find a RavenDB driver on a list of drivers and install it or if you are interested in manual installation, click on `Browse` at the bottom of the page and specify `.lpx` file with the driver.
