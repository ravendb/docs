# Querying: Aggregating and Projecting Time Series
<Admonition type="note" title="">

* **Aggregation**  
  Queries can easily create powerful statistics by aggregating time series entries 
  into groups by chosen time frames like an hour or a week, and retrieving 
  values from each group by criteria like `Min` for the lowest value, 
  `Count` for the number of values in the group, etc.  
  
* **Projection** by criteria  
  Queries can explicitly select the criteria by which values would be retrieved 
  and projected to the client.  
  When a query does **not** select specific criteria, RavenDB will consider it 
  an implicit selection of **all** criteria and project to the client the values 
  from each group, that match each criterion.  

    <Admonition type="info" title="Projecting values from Aggregated and Non-Aggregated result-sets" id="projecting-values-from-aggregated-and-non-aggregated-result-sets" href="#projecting-values-from-aggregated-and-non-aggregated-result-sets">

    * When values are selected from a time series (or a range of time series 
     entries) that **has** been aggregated, they are selected per-group.  
    * When values are selected from a series or a range that **hasn't** 
      been aggregated, they are selected from the entire result-set.

## Aggregation and Projection

In an RQL query, use the `group by` expression to aggregate 
time series (or ranges of time series entries) in groups by 
a chosen resolution. Use the `select` keyword to choose and 
project entries by a chosen criterion.  

<Admonition type="info" title="You can aggregate entries by these time units:" id="you-can-aggregate-entries-by-these-time-units" href="#you-can-aggregate-entries-by-these-time-units">  

* **Milliseconds**  
* **Seconds**  
* **Minutes**  
* **Hours**  
* **Days**  
* **Months**  
* **Quarters**  
* **Years**  

After aggregating by time units, You can also perform a 
_secondary_ aggregation by the [time series `tag`](../../../document-extensions/timeseries/overview.mdx#tags).

<Admonition type="info" title="You can `select` values for projection by these criteria:" id="you-can-select-values-for-projection-by-these-criteria" href="#you-can-select-values-for-projection-by-these-criteria">

* **Min()** - the lowest value  
* **Max()** - the highest value  
* **Sum()** - sum of all values  
* **Average()** - average value  
* **First()** - values of the first series entry  
* **Last()** - values of the last series entry  
* **Count()** - overall number of values in series entries  
* **Percentile(&lt;number between 1 and 100&gt;)** - the value that divides the other 
values in the series by the given ratio.  
* **Slope()** - the difference in value divided by the difference in time between 
the first and last entries.  
* **StandardDeviation()** - the _standard deviation_ of all the values.

## Query Examples

* In this example, we group entries of users' HeartRates time series 
  and project the lowest and highest values of each group.  
  Each HeartRates entry holds a single value.
<TabItem value="json" label="json">
<CodeBlock language="json">
{`from Employees as e
select timeseries(
    from HeartRates
    group by '1 day'
    select min(), max()
)
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
   * **group by '1 day'**  
     We group each user's HeartRates time series entries in consecutive 1-day groups.  
   * **select min(), max()**  
     We project the lowest and highest values of each group.  

* In this example, we group entries of companies' StockPrices time series 
  in consecutive 7-day groups and project the highest and lowest values 
  of each group.  
  Each StockPrices entry holds five values, the query returns the `Max` 
  and `Min` values of each:  
  Values[0] - **Open** - stock price when the trade opens  
  Values[1] - **Close** - stock price when the trade ends  
  Values[2] - **High** - highest stock price during trade time  
  Values[3] - **Low** - lowest stock price during trade time  
  Values[4] - **Volume** - overall trade volume  
<TabItem value="json" label="json">
<CodeBlock language="json">
{`declare timeseries SP(c) 
\{
    from c.StockPrices 
    where Values[4] > 500000
        group by '7 days'
        select max(), min()
\}
from Companies as c
where c.Address.Country = 'USA'
select c.Name, SP(c)
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
   * **where Values[4] &gt; 500000**  
     Query stock price behavior when the trade volume is high.  
   * **group by '7 days'**  
     Group each company's StockPrice entries in consecutive 7-day groups.  
   * **select max(), min()**  
     Select the highest (`Max`) and lowest (`Min`) 
     values of each group and project them to the client.  
     Since each entry holds 5 values, the query will project 
     5 `Max` values for each group (the highest Values[0], highest 
     Values[1], etc.) and 5 `Min` values for each group (the lowest 
     Values[0], lowest Values[1], etc.).  
   * **select c.Name, SP(c)**  
     Project the company's name along with the time series query 
     results to make the results easier to read and understand.  

* This example is similar to the one above it, except that time series 
  entries are **not aggregated**, so the highest and lowest values are 
  collected not from each group but from the entire result-set.  
<TabItem value="json" label="json">
<CodeBlock language="json">
{`declare timeseries SP(c) 
\{
    from c.StockPrices 
    where Values[4] > 500000
        select max(), min()
\}
from Companies as c
where c.Address.Country = 'USA'
select c.Name, SP(c)
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
    * **select max(), min()**  
      Since there is no aggregation, the entire result-set is queried 
      and the results include only the all-time highest and lowest Open, 
      Close, High, Low and Volume values.  

In the next two examples we group time series data by the entry tags in addition 
to the time unit aggregation.  
Tags can contain document IDs of documents in the database. If a tag is such a 
document ID, you can aggregate according to properties of that document.  

* In this query we group stock prices by 1 month and then by the tags of the 
entries within each month.  
<TabItem value="sql" label="sql">
<CodeBlock language="sql">
{`from Companies 
select timeseries(
    from StockPrices
    group by '1 month', tag
    select min(), max()
)
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
    * **group by '1 month', tag**  
      We group each company's StockPrices time series entries by their month, and within 
      each month we group by tag.  
    * **select min(), max()**  
      We project the lowest and highest values of each group.  

* In this query, we first access the entry tags using `load` into a variable called 
  `employee`. Because the tags in the StockPrices time series are the document IDs of 
  actual [employee entries](../../../start/about-examples.mdx#northwind-classes), we can 
  access the properties of the documents and filter according to their values. Then 
  we group the results by 1 month, and finally we group by the tags:  
<TabItem value="sql" label="sql">
<CodeBlock language="sql">
{`from Companies as c
select timeseries(
    from StockPrices
    load Tag as employee
    where employee.Title == 'Sales Representative'
    group by '1 month', tag
    select min(), max()
)
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
    * **load Tag as employee**
      The tags contain document IDs. This command loads the referenced documents 
      into `employee`.  
    * **where employee.Title == 'Sales Representative'**
      Filter the time series data according to the employee documents' `Title` field.  
    * **group by '1 month', tag**  
      We group each company's StockPrices time series entries by their month, and within 
      each month we group by tag.  
    * **select min(), max()**  
      We project the lowest and highest values of each group.  

* In this example we perform a LINQ query and group by 1 hour and by tag: 
<TabItem value="LINQ_GroupBy_Tag" label="LINQ_GroupBy_Tag">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`var query = session.Query<User>()
    .Select(u => RavenQuery.TimeSeries(u, "HeartRates")
        .GroupBy(g => g
                .Hours(1)
                .ByTag()
               )
        .Select(g => new
        \{
            Max = g.Max(),
            Min = g.Min()
        \}));
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>



## Client Usage Examples

<Admonition type="info" title="">
You can run queries from your client using raw RQL and LINQ.  

* Learn how to run a LINQ time series query [here](../../../document-extensions/timeseries/client-api/session/querying.mdx#time-series-linq-queries).  
* Learn how to run a raw RQL time series query [here](../../../document-extensions/timeseries/client-api/session/querying.mdx#client-raw-rql-queries).  

</Admonition>

To aggregate time series entries, use `GroupBy()` in a LINQ query 
or `group by` in a raw RQL query.  
To select time series values for projection, use `Select()` in a LINQ query 
or `select` in a raw RQL query.  

* Here we express the query we've discussed above using 
  LINQ and both RQL syntaxes.
