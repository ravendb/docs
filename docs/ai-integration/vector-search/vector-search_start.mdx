# Vector search

### Search by meaning and context using vector search operations.
Vector search operations allow you to compare [Embeddings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedding_(machine_learning)) to find content by similarity rather than by exact matches. E.g., to find text by meaning or image by context.  
- You can search over embeddings that were generated by RavenDB [ongoing embeddings-generation tasks](../../ai-integration/generating-embeddings/embeddings-generation-task) or by an external embeddings provider.  
- You can also generate the embeddings for your documents on-the-fly, while searching.  
- When you run a vector search, your search query is converted into an embedding as well, and compared against document embeddings using either a dynamic query for ad-hoc or infrequent searches, or a static index for optimized performance.  
- Vector search can be used by other RavenDB AI features. E.g., [AI agents](../../ai-integration/ai-agents/ai-agents_start) can use vector search to retrieve relevant data requested by the LLM.  

### Use cases
Vector search can help wherever you need to find similar items based on proximity rather than exact matches, e.g. -  
* **Knowledge and document search**  
  Find relevant documentation, policies, legal texts, or enterprise reports using natural language queries.
* **Product and content recommendations**  
  Suggest similar products, articles, videos, or media based on descriptive queries and user preferences.
* **Customer support automation**  
  Route questions to the best help articles, retrieve guides, and power chatbot responses with relevant information.
* **Business intelligence and analysis**  
  Profile customers and uncover market trends by comparing behavioral and relationship-based similarities.
* **Media and content analysis**  
  Discover similar images, moderate content, and monitor social media for brand mentions and sentiment.
