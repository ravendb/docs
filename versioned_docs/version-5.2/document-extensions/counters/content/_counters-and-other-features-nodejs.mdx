### Counters and Indexing  

Indexing Counters can speed-up finding them and the documents that contain them.  

* **Indexing Counter Values**
    Dynamic indexes (aka auto-indexes) _cannot_ index counter values. To index counter values, 
    create a static index that inherits from `AbstractCountersIndexCreationTask` ([see here](../../../document-extensions/counters/indexing.mdx)).

* **Indexing Counter Names**  
    Re-indexing due to Counter-name modification is normally rare enough to pause no performance issues.  
    To index a document's Counters by name, use [CounterNamesFor](../../../document-extensions/counters/indexing.mdx#section-1).  
### Counters and Queries  

Create queries **using code**, or send the server **raw queries** for execution.  

* Either way, you can query Counters **by name** but **not by value**.  
  This is because queries are generally [based on indexes](../../../start/getting-started.mdx#example-iii---querying), and Counter values are [not indexed](../../../document-extensions/counters/counters-and-other-features.mdx#counters-and-indexing).  
* Counter values **can** be [projected](../../../indexes/querying/projections.mdx) from query results, as demonstrated in the following examples.  
  This way a client can get Counter values from a query without downloading whole documents.  

* Use [Session.Query](../../../client-api/session/querying/how-to-query.mdx#sessionquery) to code queries yourself.  
   * **Returned Counter Value**: **Accumulated**  
     A Counter's value is returned as a single sum, with no specification of the Counter's value on each node.
<TabItem value="counters_region_query" label="counters_region_query">
<CodeBlock language="js">
{`const session = store.openSession();
const query = session.query(\{collection: "Products"\})
    .selectFields("ProductLikes");
const queryResults = query.all();

for (let counterValue in queryResults) \{
    console.log("ProductLikes: " + counterValue);
\}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

* Use [RawQuery](../../../client-api/session/querying/how-to-query.mdx#sessionadvancedrawquery) to send the server raw RQL expressions for execution.  
   * You can use the `counter` method.  
     **Returned Counter Value**: **Accumulated**

  * You can use the `counterRaw` method.  
     **Returned Counter Value**: **Distributed**  
     A Counter's value is returned as a series of values, each maintained by one of the nodes.  
      * It is not expected of you to use this in your application.  
        Applications normally use the Counter's overall value, and very rarely refer to the value each node gives it.  
      
        
    `counter` and `counterRaw` samples:  
<Tabs groupId='languageSyntax'>
<TabItem value="counter" label="counter">
<CodeBlock language="js">
{`//Various RQL expressions sent to the server using counter()
//Returned Counter value is accumulated
const rawquery1 = session.advanced
    .rawQuery("from products as p select counter(p, \\"ProductLikes\\")")
    .all();

const rawquery2 = session.advanced
    .rawQuery("from products select counter(\\"ProductLikes\\") as ProductLikesCount")
    .all();

const rawquery3 = session.advanced
    .rawQuery("from products where PricePerUnit > 50 select Name, counter(\\"ProductLikes\\")")
    .all();
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="counterRaw" label="counterRaw">
<CodeBlock language="js">
{`//An RQL expression sent to the server using counterRaw()
//Returned Counter value is distributed
const query = session.advanced
    .rawQuery("from users as u select counterRaw(u, \\"downloads\\")")
    .all();
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
    </Tabs>
### Counters and Revisions  

A [document revision](../../../client-api/session/revisions/what-are-revisions.mdx) stores all the document's Counters' names and values.  
 
* **Stored Counter Values**: **Accumulated**  
  A revision stores a Counter's value as a single sum, with no specification of the Counter's value on each node.  

* Revisions-creation can be initiated by **Counter-name modification**.  
   * When the Revisions feature is enabled, the creation or deletion of a Counter initiates the creation of a new document revision.  
   * Counter **value** modifications do **not** cause the creation of new revisions.  
### Counters and Smuggler  

[Smuggler](../../../client-api/smuggler/what-is-smuggler.mdx) is a DocumentStore property, that can be used 
to [export](../../../client-api/smuggler/what-is-smuggler.mdx#databasesmugglerexportoptions) chosen 
database items to an external file or to [import](../../../client-api/smuggler/what-is-smuggler.mdx#databasesmugglerimportoptions) 
database items from an existing file into the database.  

* **Transferred Counter Value**: **Distributed**  
  Smuggler transfers the entire series of values that the different nodes maintain for a Counter.  
* To make Smuggler handle Counters, use `DatabaseItemType` entities to import or export.  

`DatabaseItemType` options:  
* `None`  
* `Documents`  
* `RevisionDocuments`  
* `Indexes`  
* `Identities`  
* `Tombstones`  
* `LegacyAttachments`  
* `Conflicts`  
* `CompareExchange`  
* `LegacyDocumentDeletions`  
* `LegacyAttachmentDeletions`  
* `DatabaseRecord`  
* `Unknown`  
* `Attachments`  
* `CounterGroups`  
* `Subscriptions`  
* `CompareExchangeTombstones`  
* `TimeSeries`  
### Counters and Changes API

[Changes API](../../../client-api/changes/what-is-changes-api.mdx#changes-api) is a Push service, that can inform you of various changes on the Server, including [changes in Counter values](../../../client-api/changes/how-to-subscribe-to-counter-changes.mdx#changes-api--how-to-subscribe-to-counter-changes).  
You can target all Counters, or specify the ones you wish to follow.  

* **Pushed Counter Value**: **Accumulated**  
  `Changes API` methods return a Counter's value as a single sum, without specifying its value on each node.  
* The service is initiated by **Counter Value Modification**.  
### Counters and Ongoing Tasks:

Each [ongoing task](../../../studio/database/tasks/ongoing-tasks/general-info.mdx) relates to Counters in its own way.  

* **Counters** and the **Backup task**  
    There are two [backup](../../../studio/database/tasks/backup-task.mdx) types: **logical-backup** and **snapshot**.  
    Both types store and restore **all** data, including Counters.  
    Both types operate as an ongoing backup routine, with a pre-set time schedule.  
    * Logical Backup:  
      **Backed-up Counter values**: **Distributed**  
      A logical backup is a higher-level implementation of [Smuggler](../../../document-extensions/counters/counters-and-other-features.mdx#counters-and-smuggler).  
      As with Smuggler, Counters are backed-up and restored including their values on all nodes.  
    * Snapshot:  
      A snapshot stores all data and settings as a single binary image.
      All components, including Counters, are restored to the exact same state they've been at during backup.  

* **Counters** and the **External Replication task**  
    The ongoing [external replication](../../../studio/database/tasks/ongoing-tasks/external-replication-task.mdx) task replicates all data, including Counters.  
    * **Replicated Counter Value**: **Distributed**  
        Counters are replicated along with their values on all nodes.  
    * Replication can be initiated by both **Counter-name update** _and_ **Counter-value modification**.  

* **Counters** and the **ETL task**  
    [ETL](../../../server/ongoing-tasks/etl/basics.mdx) is used to export data from RavenDB to an external (either Raven or SQL) database.  
    * [SQL ETL](../../../server/ongoing-tasks/etl/sql.mdx) is **not supported**.  
      Counters cannot be exported to an SQL database over SQL ETL.  
    * [RavenDB ETL](../../../server/ongoing-tasks/etl/raven.mdx) **is supported**.  
      Counters [are](../../../server/ongoing-tasks/etl/raven.mdx#counters) exported over RavenDB ETL.  
      * Export can be initiated by both **Counter-name update** _and_ **Counter-value modification**.  
      * **Exported Counter Value**: **Distributed**  
        Counters are exported along with their values on all nodes.  
      * Counters can be [exported using a script](../../../server/ongoing-tasks/etl/raven.mdx#adding-counter-explicitly-in-a-script).  
        **Default behavior**: When an ETL script is not provided, Counters are exported.  
      
* **Counters** and the **[Data Subscriptions](../../../client-api/data-subscriptions/what-are-data-subscriptions.mdx#data-subscriptions) task**  
    Data Subscriptions can be initiated by document changes, including those caused by **Counter Name updates**.  
    Documents will **not** be delivered in reaction to Counter Value modification.

### Counters and Other Features: Summary

Use this table to find if and how various RavenDB features are triggered by Counters, 
and how the various features handle Counter values.  

* In the **Triggered By** column:  
    * _Document Change_ - Feature is triggered by a Counter Name update.  
    * _Countrer Value Modification_ - Feature is triggered by a Counter Value modification.  
    * _Time Schedule_ - Feature is invoked by a pre-set time routine.  
    * _No Trigger_ - Feature is executed manually, through the Studio or by a Client.  
* In the **Counter Value** column:  
    * _Accumulated_ - Counter Value is handled as a single accumulated sum.  
    * _Distributed_ - Counter Value is handled as a series of values maintained by cluster nodes.

### Including Counters  
You can [include](../../../client-api/how-to/handle-document-relationships.mdx#includes) Counters while loading a document.  
An included Counter is retrieved in the same request as its owner-document and is held by the session, 
so it can be immediately retrieved when needed with no additional remote calls.


* **Including Counters when using [Session.Load](../../../client-api/session/loading-entities.mdx#session--loading-entities)**:  
    * Include a single Counter using `IncludeCounter`.  
    * Include multiple Counters using `IncludeCounters`.  

    `IncludeCounter` and `IncludeCounters` usage samples:  
<Tabs groupId='languageSyntax'>
<TabItem value="IncludeCounter" label="IncludeCounter">
<CodeBlock language="js">
{`const productPage = await session.load("orders/1-A", {
    includes: includeBuilder => includeBuilder
        .includeDocuments("products/1-C")
        .includeCounters(["ProductLikes", "ProductDislikes"])
});
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="IncludeCounters" label="IncludeCounters">

### Counters Bulk-Insert  
`store.BulkInsert` is RavenDB's high-performance data insertion operation.  
Use its `CountersFor` interface's `Increment` method to add or update counters with great speed.  

* Usage  

   * `countersFor`
<TabItem value="CountersFor-definition" label="CountersFor-definition">
<CodeBlock language="js">
{`const counter = session.countersFor("documentid")
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

        | Parameters | Type | Description |
        |:-------------|:-------------|:-------------|
        | `id` | `string` | Document ID |

   *   `increment`
<TabItem value="Increment-definition" label="Increment-definition">
<CodeBlock language="js">
{`const incerment = store.openSession();
session.countersFor("documentid").increment("likes", 100);
//
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

           | Parameters | Type | Description |
           |:-------------|:-------------|:-------------|
           | `name` | `string` | Counter Name |
           | `delta` | `long` | Default: 1L |

* Usage Flow  

   * Create a `store.BulkInsert` instance.  
   * Pass the instance's `CountersFor` interface, the document ID  
   * Call `Increment` as many times as you like. Pass it -  
     The Counter Name and Value (delta to be added).

* Usage Sample  
  In this sample, we attach a counter to all User documents.
<TabItem value="bulk-insert-counters" label="bulk-insert-counters">
<CodeBlock language="js">
{`const query = session.query(\{collection: "User"\})
    .whereBetween("Age", 0, 30)
const result = query.all();

const bulkInsert = store.bulkInsert();
for (let user = 0; user < result.length; user++) \{
    let userId = result[user].id;

    // Choose document
    let countersFor = bulkInsert.countersFor(userId);

    // Add or Increment a counter
    await bulkInsert.countersFor(userId).increment("downloaded", 100);
\}
`}
