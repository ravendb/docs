# Configuration: Core

[settings.json](../../server/configuration/configuration-options.mdx#settingsjson) variables change your server's behavior in various ways.  

<Admonition type="note" title="">
RavenDB reads `settings.json` only during startup.  
When you edit the file, restart the server to apply changes.  
</Admonition>

## ServerUrl

The URLs which the server should listen to.

- **Type**: `string`
- **Default**: `http://localhost:8080`
- **Scope**: Server-wide only

Indicates the IP addresses or host addresses with ports and protocols that the server should listen on for requests. Use `0.0.0.0` to indicate that the server should listen for requests on any IP address or hostname using the specified port and protocol. The protocol (`http://` or `https://`) must be included with each URL.

Valid IP addresses can be localhost, domains, IPv4 or IPv6. Ports can be specified after the address using ':' as a separator, or if the default is being used: *port 80* for *http* protocol, and *port 443* for *HTTPS* protocol.

<Admonition type="note" title="">
Setting to a non loopback address using the ***HTTP*** protocol will expose the server to the network and requires security measurements (using HTTPS, certificates). When set, RavenDB will prevent a startup unless **UnsecuredAccessAllowed** is set to **PublicNetwork** manually.
</Admonition>

### Examples

* The server will listen to incoming requests in all the network devices available on the machine on the specific port

<TabItem value="plain" label="plain">
<CodeBlock language="plain">
{`http://0.0.0.0:8080
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

* The server will listen to loopback device only:

<TabItem value="plain" label="plain">
<CodeBlock language="plain">
{`http://localhost:8080
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

* Server using IPV6 loopback only address

<TabItem value="plain" label="plain">
<CodeBlock language="plain">
{`http://[0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1]:8080
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>



## ServerUrl.Tcp

The TCP URLs which the server should listen to.

- **Type**: `string`
- **Default**: `null`
- **Scope**: Server-wide only

Indicates the IP addresses or host addresses with ports and protocols that the server should listen on for incoming TCP connections, are used for inter-node communication.
Valid IP addresses can be localhost, domains, IPv4 or IPv6 addresses. Ports **must be specified** after the address using ':' as separator or just as number without address. 

If no URL is set, the ServerUrl will be used along with random port
If just a number is set, the ServerUrl will be used with the specified number as port
If the address and port are set, RavenDB will listen to the address and port specified

<Admonition type="note" title="">
Same security consideration as in ***ServerUrl*** option should be applied (see above)
</Admonition>

### Examples

* The server will listen to TCP connections in all the network devices available on the machine

<TabItem value="plain" label="plain">
<CodeBlock language="plain">
{`tcp://0.0.0.0:38888
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>



## PublicServerUrl

The URL under which server is publicly available.

- **Type**: `string`
- **Default**: `null` (local Server URL)
- **Scope**: Server-wide only

Set the URL to be accessible by clients and other nodes, regardless of which IP is used to access the server internally. This is useful when using a secured connection via https URL, or behind a proxy server. 

### Examples

* Use LAN proxy server address 10.0.0.1

<TabItem value="plain" label="plain">
<CodeBlock language="plain">
{`http://10.0.0.1:80
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

* Use a specific https domain

<TabItem value="plain" label="plain">
<CodeBlock language="plain">
{`https://example.com:8080
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

<Admonition type="note" title="">
In the above example, `example.com` is the external domain/ip provided by the ISP, and `ServerUrl` must be specified when the server is behind a firewall, proxy, or router
</Admonition>



## PublicServerUrl.Tcp

The TCP URL under which server is publicly listened to.

- **Type**: `string`
- **Default**: `null`
- **Scope**: Server-wide only

Set the public TCP address of the server. Used for inter-node communication and access from behind a firewall, proxy, etc.

### Examples

<TabItem value="plain" label="plain">
<CodeBlock language="plain">
{`tcp://example.com:38888
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>



## ServerUrl.Cluster

When this configuration option is used to expose a server's 
internal IP address, other servers will try to communicate with 
it through this IP first. If the communication fails, they will 
failover to its public IP/URL.  

Using internal IPs (rather than the public network, requiring DNS 
resolutions etc.) can **accelerate internal cluster communications**.  

<Admonition type="info" title="">
Internal cluster communications can be particularly useful when the 
cluster is [sharded](../../sharding/overview.mdx), because of the amount 
of internal communication needed: for a shard to satisfy its client 
requests, it often has to communicate with all other shards. Performing 
these communications internally can provide a better user experience, 
and save much time and money over time.  
</Admonition>

- **Type**: `UriSetting`
- **Default**: `null`
- **Scope**: Server-wide only

### Examples

<TabItem value="plain" label="plain">
<CodeBlock language="plain">
{`// must include http or https
http://192.168.10.9
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="plain" label="plain">
<CodeBlock language="plain">
{`// can include port number
https://example.com:8080
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>



## ExternalIp

External IP address.

- **Type**: `string`
- **Default**: `null`
- **Scope**: Server-wide only



## RunInMemory

Set whether the database should run purely in memory.

- **Type**: `bool`
- **Default**: `null`
- **Scope**: Server-wide or per database

When running in memory, RavenDB does not write to the disk. If the server is restarted, all data will be lost. This is mostly useful for testing.



## DataDir

Path to the directory where RavenDB stores your data (databases, documents, and indexes).  
Relative paths will be based from the application base directory (where the `Raven.Server` executable is located).  
Learn more about RavenDB directory structure in: [Storage: Directory Structure](../../server/storage/directory-structure.mdx).

- **Type**: `string`
- **Default**: `RavenData`
- **Scope**: Server-wide or per database

#### Examples

<Tabs groupId="operatingSystem">
  <TabItem value="Relative_path" label="Relative_path">
    ```plain
    MyRavenDataFolder
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Absolute_path_Linux" label="Absolute_path_Linux">
    ```plain
    /home/user/myRavenDataFolder
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Absolute_path_Windows" label="Absolute_path_Windows">
    ```plain
    C:\RavenDB\Data
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


## Setup.Mode

Determines what kind of security was chosen during setup, or not to use setup on startup at all (`None`).

- **Type**: `enum`
- **Default**: `None`
- **Scope**: Server-wide only

Possible values:

- `None`: No setup process on RavenDB server startup
- `Initial`: Start the wizard process to setup RavenDB on the first server startup
- `LetsEncrypt`: Let RavenDB know that it needs to take care of refreshing certificates on the fly via LE
- `Secured`: This value will be set internally by RavenDB
- `Unsecured`: Run the server in unsecured mode



## AcmeUrl

The URLs which the server should contact when requesting certificates from using the ACME protocol.

- **Type**: `string`
- **Default**: `https://acme-v01.api.letsencrypt.org/directory`
- **Scope**: Server-wide only



## ThrowIfAnyIndexCannotBeOpened

 Indicates if we should throw an exception if any index could not be opened.

- **Type**: `bool`
- **Default**: `false`
- **Scope**: Server-wide or per database



## Features.Availability

This [settings.json](../../server/configuration/configuration-options.mdx#settingsjson) variable determines whether to run RavenDB with its standard 
features set, or add to a set of experimental features.  
Some features, like ones recently released, are considered **experimental**. They are disabled by default, you can enable 
them by setting `Features.Availability` to `Experimental`.  

- **Type**: `enum`
- **Default**: `Stable`
- **Scope**: Server-wide only

Possible values:

- `Stable`: Standard set of features  
- `Experimental`: Enables experimental features  

<Admonition type="note" title="">
We'd be grateful for any feedback you send us regarding experimental features.
