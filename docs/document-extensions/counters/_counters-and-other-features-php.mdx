### Counters and Indexing  

Indexing Counters can speed-up finding them and the documents that contain them.  

* **Indexing Counter Values**
    Dynamic indexes (aka auto-indexes) _cannot_ index counter values. To index counter values, 
    create a static index that inherits from `AbstractCountersIndexCreationTask` ([see here](../../document-extensions/counters/indexing.mdx)).

* **Indexing Counter Names**  
    Re-indexing due to Counter-name modification is normally rare enough to pause no performance issues.  
    To index a document's Counters by name, use [CounterNamesFor](../../document-extensions/counters/indexing.mdx#section-1).  
### Counters and Queries  

Send the server **raw queries** for execution.  

* You can query Counters **by name** but **not by value**.  
  This is because queries are generally [based on indexes](../../start/getting-started.mdx#example-iii---querying), and Counter values are [not indexed](../../document-extensions/counters/counters-and-other-features.mdx#counters-and-indexing).  
* Counter values **can** be [projected](../../indexes/querying/projections.mdx) from query results, as demonstrated in the following examples.  
  This way a client can get counter values from a query without downloading whole documents.  

* Use [RawQuery](../../querying/overview.mdx#session-advanced-rawquery) to send the server raw RQL expressions for execution.  
   * You can use the `counter` method.  
     **Returned Counter Value**: **Accumulated**

  * You can use the `counterRaw` method.  
     **Returned Counter Value**: **Distributed**  
     A Counter's value is returned as a series of values, each maintained by one of the nodes.  
      * It is not expected of you to use this in your application.  
        Applications normally use the Counter's overall value, and very rarely refer to the value each node gives it.  
      
        
    `counter` and `counterRaw` samples:  
<Tabs groupId='languageSyntax'>
<TabItem value="counter" label="counter">
<CodeBlock language="php">
{`//Various RQL expressions sent to the server using counter()
//Returned Counter value is accumulated
$rawQuery1 = $session->advanced()
    ->rawQuery(CounterResult::class, "from products as p select counter(p, \\"ProductLikes\\")")
    ->toList();

$rawQuery2 = $session->advanced()
    ->rawQuery(CounterResult::class,"from products select counter(\\"ProductLikes\\") as ProductLikesCount")
    ->toList();

$rawQuery3 = $session->advanced()
    ->rawQuery(CounterResult::class,"from products where PricePerUnit > 50 select Name, counter(\\"ProductLikes\\")")
    ->toList();
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="counterRaw" label="counterRaw">
<CodeBlock language="php">
{`//An RQL expression sent to the server using counterRaw()
//Returned Counter value is distributed
$query = $session->advanced()
    ->rawQuery(CounterResultRaw::class, "from users as u select counterRaw(u, \\"downloads\\")")
    ->toList();
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
    </Tabs>
### Counters and Revisions  

A document revision stores all the document Counters' names and values when the revision was created.  
 
* **Stored Counter Values**: **Accumulated**  
  A revision stores a Counter's value as a single sum, with no specification of the Counter's value on each node.  

* Revisions-creation can be initiated by **Counter-name modification**.  
   * When the Revisions feature is enabled, the creation or deletion of a Counter initiates the creation of a new document revision.  
   * Counter **value** modifications do **not** cause the creation of new revisions.  
### Counters and Changes API

[Changes API](../../client-api/changes/what-is-changes-api.mdx#changes-api) is a Push service, that can inform you of various changes on the Server, including [changes in Counter values](../../client-api/changes/how-to-subscribe-to-counter-changes.mdx#changes-api--how-to-subscribe-to-counter-changes).  
You can target all Counters, or specify the ones you wish to follow.  

* **Pushed Counter Value**: **Accumulated**  
  `Changes API` methods return a Counter's value as a single sum, without specifying its value on each node.  
* The service is initiated by **Counter Value Modification**.  
### Counters and Ongoing Tasks:

Each [ongoing task](../../studio/database/tasks/ongoing-tasks/general-info.mdx) relates to Counters in its own way.  

* **Counters** and the **Backup task**  
    There are two [backup](../../studio/database/tasks/backup-task.mdx) types: **logical-backup** and **snapshot**.  
    Both types store and restore **all** data, including Counters.  
    Both types operate as an ongoing backup routine, with a pre-set time schedule.  
    * Logical Backup:  
      **Backed-up Counter values**: **Distributed**  
      A logical backup is a higher-level implementation of Smuggler.  
      As with Smuggler, Counters are backed-up and restored including their values on all nodes.  
    * Snapshot:  
      A snapshot stores all data and settings as a single binary image.
      All components, including Counters, are restored to the exact same state they've been at during backup.  

* **Counters** and the **External Replication task**  
    The ongoing [external replication](../../studio/database/tasks/ongoing-tasks/external-replication-task.mdx) task replicates all data, including Counters.  
    * **Replicated Counter Value**: **Distributed**  
        Counters are replicated along with their values on all nodes.  
    * Replication can be initiated by both **Counter-name update** _and_ **Counter-value modification**.  

* **Counters** and the **ETL task**  
    [ETL](../../server/ongoing-tasks/etl/basics.mdx) is used to export data from RavenDB to an external (either Raven or SQL) database.  
    * [SQL ETL](../../server/ongoing-tasks/etl/sql.mdx) is **not supported**.  
      Counters cannot be exported to an SQL database over SQL ETL.  
    * [RavenDB ETL](../../server/ongoing-tasks/etl/raven.mdx) **is supported**.  
      Counters [are](../../server/ongoing-tasks/etl/raven.mdx#counters) exported over RavenDB ETL.  
      * Export can be initiated by both **Counter-name update** _and_ **Counter-value modification**.  
      * **Exported Counter Value**: **Distributed**  
        Counters are exported along with their values on all nodes.  
      * Counters can be [exported using a script](../../server/ongoing-tasks/etl/raven.mdx#adding-counter-explicitly-in-a-script).  
        **Default behavior**: When an ETL script is not provided, Counters are exported.

### Counters and Other Features: Summary

Use this table to find if and how various RavenDB features are triggered by Counters, 
and how the various features handle Counter values.  

* In the **Triggered By** column:  
    * _Document Change_ - Feature is triggered by a Counter Name update.  
    * _Countrer Value Modification_ - Feature is triggered by a Counter Value modification.  
    * _Time Schedule_ - Feature is invoked by a pre-set time routine.  
    * _No Trigger_ - Feature is executed manually, through the Studio or by a Client.  
* In the **Counter Value** column:  
    * _Accumulated_ - Counter Value is handled as a single accumulated sum.  
    * _Distributed_ - Counter Value is handled as a series of values maintained by cluster nodes.
