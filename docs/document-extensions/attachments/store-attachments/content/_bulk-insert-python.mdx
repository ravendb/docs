* [bulk_insert](../../../client-api/bulk-insert/how-to-work-with-bulk-insert-operation) is RavenDB's 
  high-performance data insertion operation.  
  Use its `attachments_for` interface to add attachments to multiple documents with great speed.  

* In this page:  
    * [Usage flow](../../../document-extensions/attachments/store-attachments/bulk-insert#usage-flow)  
    * [Usage example](../../../document-extensions/attachments/store-attachments/bulk-insert#usage-example)

</Admonition>

## Usage flow

* Create a `bulk_insert` instance.  

* Pass the Document ID to the instance's `attachments_for` method.

* To add an attachment, call the `store` method.  
  Pass it the attachment's name, stream, and type (optional).  
  `store` can be called repeatedly, as many times as needed.  

* Note:  
  If an attachment with the specified name already exists on the document,  
  the bulk insert operation will overwrite it.

## Usage example

In this example, we attach a file to all User documents that match a query.  

<TabItem value="bulk_insert_attachment" label="bulk_insert_attachment">
<CodeBlock language="python">
{`# Choose user profiles for which to attach a file
with store.open_session() as session:
    user_ids = [
        session.advanced.get_document_id(user)
        for user in list(session.query(object_type=User).where_less_than("Age", 30))
    ]

# Prepare content to attach
bytes_to_attach = b"some contents here"

# Create a BulkInsert instance
with store.bulk_insert() as bulk_insert:
    for user_id in user_ids:
        # Call 'attachments_for', pass the document ID for which to attach the file
        attachments_bulk_insert = bulk_insert.attachments_for(user_id)

        # Call 'store' to add the file to the BulkInsert instance
        # The data stored in bulk_insert will be streamed to the server in batches
        attachments_bulk_insert.store("AttachmentName", bytes_to_attach)
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
