* RavenDB's distributed counters, **Counters** for short, are numeric data variables that can be added to documents. 
  Use a Counter to count anything that needs counting, like:
   * Sold products  
   * Voting results  
   * Any event related to the document  
   
* Counters interact with and can trigger other RavenDB features.  
 To find out how to use counters with other features, read [Counters and Other Features](../../document-extensions/counters/counters-and-other-features).  

* Create and manage Counters using API methods, or through the [Studio](../../studio/database/document-extensions/counters.mdx).

## Why use Counters?

#### Convenient Counting Mechanism

Counters are very easy to manage, using simple API methods or through the Studio.  

E.g. Use counters when you want to -  

- Keep track of the number of times a document has been viewed or rated.  
- Count how many visitors from certain countries or regions read a document.  
- Continuously record the number of visitors on an event page.  
- Avoid having to update the whole document for just a numeric value change.  
- Have a need for a high-throughput counter (also see **Distributed Values** below).  
#### Distributed Values

A Counter's value is [distributed between cluster nodes](../../document-extensions/counters/counters-in-clusters.mdx).  
Among the advantages of this:  

* The cluster **remains available** even when nodes crash.  
* Any node can provide or modify a Counter's value immediately, without checking or coordinating this with other nodes.  
#### High Performance, Low Resources

A document includes the Counter's _name_, while the Counter's actual _value_ is kept in a separate location.  
Modifying a Counter's value doesn't require the modification of the document itself.  
This results in highly efficient operation.
#### High-Frequency Counting

Counters are especially useful when a very large number of counting operations is required,  
because of their speed and low resources usage.  

E.g. Use Counters - 

- For an online election page, to continuously update a Number-Of-Votes Counter for each candidate.  
- To continuously update Counters with the number of visitors in different sections of a big online store.  



## Overview

#### Design

A document's metadata contains only the ***Counters' names-list*** for this document.  
***Counter Values*** are not kept in the document's metadata, but in a separate location.  

Therefore, changes like adding a new counter or deleting an existing counter trigger a document change,  
while simply modifying the Counter Value does not.  
#### Cumulative Counter Actions

* Counter value-modification actions are cumulative, the order in which they are executed doesn't matter.  
  E.g., It doesn't matter if a Counter has been incremented by 2 and then by 7, or by 7 first and then by 2.  

* When a Counter is deleted, the sequence of Counter actions becomes non-cumulative and may require 
  [special attention](../../document-extensions/counters/counters-in-clusters.mdx#concurrent-delete-and-increment).  
#### Counters and Conflicts

Counter actions (for either name or value) almost never cause conflicts.  
The only exception to this is [concurrent `delete` and `increment`](../../document-extensions/counters/counters-in-clusters.mdx#concurrent-delete-and-increment) 
actions by multiple cluster nodes.  

- Counter actions can be executed concurrently or in any order, without causing a conflict.  
- You can successfully modify Counters while their document is being modified by a different client.  

<Admonition type="note" title="">
Counter actions **can still be performed** when their related documents are in a conflicted state.  
</Admonition>
#### Counters Cost

Counters are designated to lower the cost of counting, but do come with a price.  

* **All the names** of a document's Counters are added to its content, increasing its size.  
* **Counter values** occupy storage space.  

<Admonition type="note" title="">
Be aware that the negligible amount of resources required by a few Counters, 
may become significant when there are many.  
A single document with thousands of Counters is probably an indication of a modeling mistake, 
for example.  
</Admonition>
#### Counters Naming Convention

* Valid characters: All visible characters, [including Unicode symbols](../../studio/database/document-extensions/counters.mdx#section)  
* Length: Up to 512 bytes  
* Encoding: UTF-8  
#### Counter Values

* Valid range: Signed 64-bit integer (-9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807)  
* Only integer additions are supported (no floats or other mathematical operations).
#### Number of Counters Per Document

RavenDB doesn't limit the number of Counters you can create.  

<Admonition type="note" title="">
Note that the Counter names are stored in the document metadata and [do impact the size of the document](../../document-extensions/counters/overview.mdx#counters-cost).  
</Admonition>
#### The `HasCounters` Flag

When a Counter is added to a document, RavenDB automatically sets a `HasCounters` Flag in the document's metadata.  
When all Counters are removed from a document, the server automatically removes this flag.  



## Managing Counters

#### Counter Methods and the `counters_for` Object

Managing Counters is performed using the `counters_for` session object.  

*  **Counter methods**: 
 
 | Method                  | Description                                                                             |
 |-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 | `counters_for.increment` | Increment the value of an existing Counter, or create a new Counter if it doesn't exist |
 | `counters_for.delete`    | Delete a Counter                                                                        |
 | `counters_for.get`       | Get the current value of a Counter                                                      |
 | `counters_for.get_all`    | Get *all* the Counters of a document and their values                                   |


* **Usage flow**:  
  * Open a session.  
  * Create an instance of `counters_for`.  
      * Either pass `counters_for` an explicit document ID, -or-  
      * Pass it an [entity tracked by the session](../../client-api/session/loading-entities.mdx), 
        e.g. a document object returned from [session.query](../../client-api/session/querying/how-to-query.mdx) or from [session.load](../../client-api/session/loading-entities.mdx#load).  
  * Use Counter methods to manage the document's Counters.  
  * If you execute [increment](../../document-extensions/counters/create-or-modify.mdx) or [delete](../../document-extensions/counters/delete.mdx), call `session.save_changes` for the action to take effect on the server.  

* **Success and failure**:  
  * As long as the document exists, Counter actions (Increment, Get, Delete etc.) always succeed.
  * When a transaction that includes a Counter modification fails for any reason (e.g. a document concurrency conflict),  
    the Counter modification is reverted.

* **`counters_for` usage samples**:  
  * You can Use `counters_for` by **explicitly passing it a document ID** (without pre-loading the document).  
  * You can also use `counters_for` by passing it **the document object**.

#### Managing Counters using `Operations`

* In addition to working with the high-level Session, you can manage Counters using the low-level [Operations](../../client-api/operations/what-are-operations.mdx).  

* [CounterBatchOperation](../../client-api/operations/counters/counter-batch.mdx) 
can operate on a set of Counters of different documents in a single request.
