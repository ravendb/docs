# Legacy versions data Migration
<Admonition type="note" title="">

* Learn in this article how to upgrade RavenDB versions lower than `6.x`.

* Find a migration guide for RavenDB `6.x` and above [here](../../migration/server/data-migration.mdx).

* In this article:
    * [Migration from RavenDB 5.x to a higher version](../../migration/server/legacy-versions-data-migration#migration-from-ravendb-5-x-to-a-higher-version)
    * [Migration from RavenDB 4.x to a higher version](../../migration/server/legacy-versions-data-migration#migration-from-ravendb-4-x-to-a-higher-version)
    * [Migration from RavenDB 3.x to a higher version](../../migration/server/legacy-versions-data-migration#migration-from-ravendb-3-x-to-a-higher-version)

<Panel heading="Migration from RavenDB 5.x to a higher version">

* Upgrading RavenDB `5.x` to a higher version supports in-place data migration: exporting and re-importing the data are not needed.  

* RavenDB `5.x` licenses **do not apply** to RavenDB `6.x` and above.  
  To upgrade a valid `5.x` license to a RavenDB `6.x` and above license, use the **License upgrade tool** [as explained here](../../licensing/replace-license.mdx#upgrade-a-license-key-for-ravendb-6x).

<Admonition type="warning" title="">
Note that once upgraded, RavenDB `6.x` and higher versions cannot be downgraded to version `5.x`, and the migrated data will no longer be accessible via RavenDB `5.x`.  
Create a backup of your data before upgrading to keep the data safe and accessible.

<Panel heading="Migration from RavenDB 4.x to a higher version">

* Upgrading RavenDB `4.x` to version `5.x` or higher supports in-place data migration: exporting and re-importing the data are not needed.  
  <Admonition type="info" title="">
  Upgrading directly from version `4.x` to `6.x` and above is possible, but it is recommended to upgrade RavenDB `4.x` to `5.x` first, and then proceed with an upgrade from version `5.x` to `6.x` or above.

* RavenDB `4.x` licenses **do not apply** to RavenDB `6.x` and above.  
  To upgrade a valid `4.x` license to a RavenDB `6.x` and above license, use the **License upgrade tool** [as explained here](../../licensing/replace-license.mdx#upgrade-a-license-key-for-ravendb-6x).
