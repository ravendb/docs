#What are commands?

Commands are a set of low level operations that can be used to manipulate data on the RavenFS instance.

They are accessible from the `IFilesStore` object by using `AsyncFilesCommands` property:

<TabItem value="commands_access" label="commands_access">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`IAsyncFilesCommands commands = store.AsyncFilesCommands;
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

Note that in contrast to [RavenDB commands](../../../client-api/commands/what-are-commands.mdx), RavenFS client exposes only the async methods.

## Working with multiple file systems

By default file commands are executed against the `DefaultFileSystem` configured in the `FilesStore`. However, you can perform the command actions on another existing file system. Note that this file system may require different credentials. Take a look at the example:

<TabItem value="commands_different_fs" label="commands_different_fs">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`IAsyncFilesCommands southwindCommands = store
	.AsyncFilesCommands
	.ForFileSystem("SouthwindFS")
	.With(new NetworkCredential("user", "pass"));
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
