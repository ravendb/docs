# Multi-Database Support

RavenDB supports multi-tenancy, and the Management Studio provides an easy way to manage multiple tenants from the same UI, and to create new tenants.

{NOTE You cannot delete a database using the Management Studio. /}

At the top right corner of each screen, by the RavenDB logo, the name of the current tenant you are working against is shown. Clicking on it will open a list of other available tenants, and selecting another one from that list will shift the Studio to working against that tenant.

After selecting this option a window will pop up and you need to enter a name for the new database.

{NOTE Each database must have a unique name /e}

Once you have selected the name a new empty database will be created. The name of the selected database will appear on the top right next the databases link:
