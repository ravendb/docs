# Bundle: Scripted Index Results

Scripted Index Results bundle allows you to attach scripts to indexes. Those scripts can operate on the results of the indexing. It opens a lot of opportunities like a modification
of documents by index calculated values or recursive map/reduce indexes.

In order to enable this bundle you need to add `ScriptedIndexResults` to `Raven/ActiveBundles` setting of a database document when a database is created (or via the studio):

<TabItem value="activate_bundle" label="activate_bundle">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`store.DatabaseCommands.CreateDatabase(new DatabaseDocument
\{
 Id = "Northwind",
 Settings =
		 \{
			 \{"Raven/ActiveBundles", "ScriptedIndexResults"\}
		 \}
\});
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

The activation of the bundle adds a database index update trigger which is run when an index entry is created or deleted. In order to take advantage of this feature for a selected index
you need to put a special setup document under key `Raven/ScriptedIndexResults/[IndexName]` that will contain the appropriate scripts to apply:

<TabItem value="setup_doc" label="setup_doc">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`using (var session = store.OpenSession())
\{
 session.Store(new ScriptedIndexResults
 \{
	 Id = ScriptedIndexResults.IdPrefix + "IndexName",
	 IndexScript = @"", // index script
	 DeleteScript = @"" // delete script body
 \});

 session.SaveChanges();
\}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

## Example

Let us assume that we have the following index:

<TabItem value="index_def" label="index_def">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`public class OrdersByCompany : AbstractIndexCreationTask<Order, OrderResult>
\{
	public OrdersByCompany()
	\{
		Map = orders => from order in orders
		                select new
			                \{
				                order.Company, 
								Count = 1, 
								Total = order.Lines.Sum(l => (l.Quantity * l.Price))
			                \};

		Reduce = results => from result in results
		                    group result by result.Company
		                    into g
		                    select new
			                    \{
				                    Company = g.Key,
				                    Count = g.Sum(x => x.Count),
				                    Total = g.Sum(x => x.Total)
			                    \};
	\}
\}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

Now we want to embed the reduced values inside the company document, so let's create the setup document:

<TabItem value="sample_setup_doc" label="sample_setup_doc">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`using (var session = store.OpenSession())
\{
session.Store(new ScriptedIndexResults
\{
	Id = ScriptedIndexResults.IdPrefix + new OrdersByCompany().IndexName,
	IndexScript = @"
		var company = LoadDocument(this.Company);
		if(company == null)
				return;
		company.Orders = \{ Count: this.Count, Total: this.Total \};
		PutDocument(this.Company, company);
	",
	DeleteScript = @"
		var company = LoadDocument(key);
		if(company == null)
				return;
		delete company.Orders;
		PutDocument(key, company);
	"
               \});
\}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

Since this document is stored in the database every time when _Orders/ByCompany_ index creates a new index entry then _IndexScript_ will be applied to reduce result. Under
`this` keyword in the _IndexScript_ script you have an access to the _Company_ , _Count_ and _Total_ values.  As you can see the script uses the built-in `LoadDocument` and `PutDocument` functions
in order to modify a company document. Note that we need to ensure that if the index entry is deleted we will revert the changes by using the _DeleteScript_ script. Notice that we no longer have access under _this_ to our calculated values, the only available variable is 'key' which is a document key.

Now if you take a look at the documents from the companies collection after orders indexation then you will see the added values. For example:

```json 
	{ 
		"Id" : "companies/1", 
		...
		"Orders" : {
			"Count" : 7,
			"Total" : 1234
		}
	}
```
