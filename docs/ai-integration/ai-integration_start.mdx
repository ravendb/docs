# AI Integration: Start

RavenDB is equipped with a set of powerful native AI features, including Embeddings generation tasks, Vector search, AI agents, and GenAI tasks.

* **Embeddings and Vector search**  
  [Embeddings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedding_(machine_learning)) are mathematical representations of content, where the content is converted into high-dimensional numerical vectors that capture semantic meanings and relationships. RavenDB allows you to create [ongoing embeddings-generation tasks](../ai-integration/generating-embeddings/embeddings-generation_start) that systematically process document collections and convert document fields (e.g., texts, arrays, or metadata) into embeddings.  
   - [Vector search](../ai-integration/vector-search/vector-search_start) operations let you find semantically similar content by comparing embeddings. You can search over embeddings pre-generated by embeddings-generation tasks, or generate the embeddings for your documents on-the-fly during the search operation.
   - Your search query is converted into an embedding as well, and compared against document embeddings using either a dynamic query for quick searches or a static index for optimized performance.  
   - This enables semantic searches based on meaning rather than exact keyword matches.  
   - Vector search and generated embeddings can be used by other RavenDB AI features, including **GenAI tasks** and **AI agents**.  
   - Both embeddings-generation tasks and vector search can create embeddings using an external AI provider (such as OpenAI) or RavenDB's default embedding model. (Be sure to use the same model to both generate and query the embeddings.)  

* [AI agents](../ai-integration/ai-agents/ai-agents_start) are built to easily integrate AI capabilities into RavenDB clients.  
  An AI agent serves as a client's proxy to an AI model; the agent can maintain a continuous conversation with the model, and enable the model to securely query a RavenDB database and request the client to perform actions.  
  Using AI agents frees developers from the need to manage an AI model in their code, enhances the model by giving it access to a credible and relevant data source, and opens the door to numerous operational scenarios.  

* [GenAI tasks](../ai-integration/gen-ai-integration/gen-ai_start) are [ongoing operations](../studio/database/tasks/ongoing-tasks/general-info) that continuously monitor specified collections, processing documents as they are added or modified.  
  Similar to ETL tasks, a GenAI task extracts content from documents, but instead of sending the content to another database, the task sends it to an AI model (like OpenAI) along with a guiding **prompt** and a **JSON schema** that defines the layout for the model's response.  
  When the LLM responds, the GenAI task can use this response to update the source document, create new documents in the database, and so on.  
  GenAI tasks can infuse intelligence into a wide variety of content handling scenarios, like enriching documents with AI-generated summaries or classifications, translating text into different languages, or generating new content based on existing data.

## Use cases

Creating an AI agent and assigning it a role can be done in minutes using Studio or the API, making it easy to address a wide variety of use cases like -    

- [Customer support chatbot agents](../ai-integration/ai-agents/ai-agents_overview#customer-support-chatbot-agents)  
- [Data analysis and reporting agents](../ai-integration/ai-agents/ai-agents_overview#data-analysis-and-reporting-agents)  
- [Automated content generation agents](../ai-integration/ai-agents/ai-agents_overview#automated-content-generation-agents)  
- [Workflow automation agents](../ai-integration/ai-agents/ai-agents_overview#workflow-automation-agents)  
- [Intelligent recommendation agents](../ai-integration/ai-agents/ai-agents_overview#intelligent-recommendation-agents)  


## Technical documentation

Our technical documentation explains in detail what AI agents are and how to define and use them.  
If you're new to AI agents, we recommend the [overview](../ai-integration/ai-agents/ai-agents_overview) page as a good starting point.
