# Migration: How to Migrate Suggestions from 3.x

Suggestion functionality has been merged into [RQL](../../../../indexes/querying/what-is-rql.mdx). To reflect this change, the Client API has integrated this feature into the `session.Query` and `session.Advanced.DocumentQuery`. The following migration samples will focus on the `session.Query`, the most common and recommended way of interaction with querying capabilities on RavenDB.
