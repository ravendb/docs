# Azure Functions: Deployment Considerations
<Admonition type="note" title="Note">

This document describes different things to consider when deploying RavenDB 
serverless workloads to Microsoft Azure Functions platform.

## Linux or Windows?

Azure Functions allows you to deploy Function Apps on Linux or Windows. For RavenDB, this mainly 
affects the way certificates are loaded and handled.  

**Using a Windows deployment plus `.NET` Azure Functions will provide the most secure and performant option.**  
This will allow you to upload client certificates through the Portal and make them accessible to your `.NET` 
functions with the `WEBSITE_LOAD_CERTIFICATES` application setting.  
Furthermore, `.NET` Core functions have the lowest cold start times compared to Node.js.  

**If you prefer to use Node.js,** you can choose Linux or Windows.  
The template is configured to support a PEM-encoded certificate loaded through an environment 
variable due to a limitation with cross-platform support for `WEBSITE_LOAD_CERTIFICATES` (see 
[this issue][ms-issue-linux-certs-unsupported] on the Azure Functions repo).  



## Document Store Lifetime and Cold Starts

One of the benefits of serverless is that you can potentially lower costs for less-used services 
and pay-per-invocation.  
As a trade-off, these functions incur a startup cost known as a "cold start" before they can serve requests.  

The Document Store is meant to be instantiated once for the lifetime of an application.  
However, cold vs. warm starts in serverless environments have some implications on this.  

In Azure Functions, the document store will be shared across invocations of a Function as 
long as it remains warmed up.  
For Functions being invoked more than once every 60 seconds, the document store will remain 
initialized and you should not see an impact to latency.  

If an Azure Function is wound down, the next time it is invoked will incur a cold start cost.  
The vast majority of cold start time is due to the Azure Function runtime. Document store initialization 
will not have a major impact on latency, as establishing the TCP & TLS connection is still quite fast.  

To reduce cold starts, consider switching from the Consumption (Pay-as-you-Go) plan to a Premium App 
Service Plan which will allow you to keep Functions warm for longer periods of time.
