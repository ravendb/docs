# Defining a static index

As we have seen, defining a static index allows for more sophisticated queries and is also likely to reduce staleness for some scenarios, and this is generally preferred over relying on dynamic indexes.

To define a new index manually, you need to create an `IndexDefinition` object and pass it to the database. Once notified of the new index, the RavenDB server will execute a background indexing task to build the index. An index can be queried immediately after the indexing process has started, but until the process is finished the query results will be marked as stale. The index will be constantly updated when additions or edits occur.

## The IndexDefinition class

An index definition is composed of an index name, Map/Reduce functions, an optional TransformResults function and several other indexing options. The structure of the internal `IndexDefinition` class is shown here:

<TabItem value="index_definition" label="index_definition">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`class IndexDefinition
\{
	/// <summary>
	/// Get or set the name of the index
	/// </summary>
	public string Name \{ get; set; \}

	/// <summary>
	/// Get or set the index lock mode
	/// </summary>
	public IndexLockMode LockMode \{ get; set; \}

	/// <summary>
	/// Gets or sets the map function, if there is only one
	/// </summary>
	public string Map \{ get; set; \}

	/// <summary>

	public HashSet<string> Maps \{ get; set; \}

	/// <summary>

	/// </summary>
	/// <value>The reduce.</value>
	public string Reduce \{ get; set; \}

	/// <summary>

	public string TransformResults \{ get; set; \}

\}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

### Map

Every index is required to have a name and at least one map function. The map functions are the way for us to tell RavenDB how to filter out the data we are interested in (fields we are going to be searching on). 
They are written in Linq, just like you'd write a simple query. If you index definition contains only maps then according to their definitions, values selected from documents that belongs to the specified collection 
will be stored inside a persistent Lucene index. The map function does not change any document values, just indicates which ones should be taken into account to index. This way we will be able to
perform low cost queries over the stored values. 

If you also define a reduce function (described below) then your index is going to be considered as map/reduce. Then steps of the index processing are different than for a simple index (map-only).
The map function that is executed over the set of documents, the same like previously, filters data of documents and produces an output called *mapped results*. This one is stored internally in RavenDB 
and it becomes an input for the reduce function. 

<Admonition type="note" title="">
The map functions defined in multi map index must return identical types.
</Admonition>

### Reduce

The reduce function is an optional, written and executed just like the map function, but this time against the mapped results. In accordance with its name it takes the output of map functions
and reduces the values. This is a second pass of the map/reduce index processing. The reduce function aggregates the incoming data set based on a *reduce key* (given in `group by` clause)
and performs an actual operation over the groupped items. The values are calculated and then the actual results are stored into Lucene index. 

<Admonition type="note" title="">
The reduce function must be able to process the map function output as well as its own output. This is required because reduce may be applied recursively to its own output. This means is that the output of map and reduce functions must be the same type.
</Admonition>

### TransformResults

The third function, `TransformResults`, is a part of a feature called Live Projections. It has no effect on values that are stored into Lucene index but when it was applied then a processing of a query will take additional step on a server. 
Before the RavenDB will send the query results to the client it will transform them according to the transform results definition. Then only the projected document values will be sent. More details about Live Projections you will find [here](live-projections).

### Index options

The remaining properties are useful for leveraging the full power of Lucene by customizing the indexes even further. We will discuss them in depth later in this chapter.

## Creating a new index

Once we figured out how our index should look like, we can go ahead and tell the server to create it, so the indexing process can start. The most straight-forward way to do that is through the `PutIndex` function, available from the `DatabaseCommands` object:

<TabItem value="static_indexes2" label="static_indexes2">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`// Create an index where we search based on a post title
documentStore.DatabaseCommands.PutIndex("BlogPosts/ByTitles",
										new IndexDefinitionBuilder<BlogPost>
										\{
											Map = posts => from post in posts
														   select new \{ post.Title \}
										\});
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

<Admonition type="note" title="">
Note the use the generic `IndexDefinitionBuilder` class. It builds an `IndexDefinition` object for you based on the Linq queries you specified. If needed you can pass an `IndexDefinition` object with the Map/Reduce functions as strings.
</Admonition>

A cleaner way to do this, which is also the recommended one, is to create an index class inheriting  from `AbstractIndexCreationTask<T>`, and name it after the indexing operation it does. In the constructor of that class you have access to all the the index properties, which you can change to match your.

Telling the server to create the actual index is done by adding the following call on application startup. This one liner will submit all `AbstractIndexCreationTask<T>` classes for creation as indexes on the server (existing indexes will remain untouched):

<TabItem value="static_indexes5" label="static_indexes5">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`IndexCreation.CreateIndexes(typeof(MyIndexClass).Assembly, documentStore);
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

With this approach each index can be in its own file, what makes it much easier to work with in case you have a lot of them.

## Putting indexes into practice

Let's assume we have a blog with many posts, each filed under several tags, and we wish to know how many posts are under each of the tags. One way to do this would be as follows:

<TabItem value="static_indexes3" label="static_indexes3">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`documentStore.DatabaseCommands.PutIndex(
	"BlogPosts/PostsCountByTag",
	new IndexDefinitionBuilder<BlogPost, BlogTagPostsCount>
	\{
		// The Map function: for each tag of each post, create a new BlogTagPostsCount
		// object with the name of a tag and a count of one.
		Map = posts => from post in posts
					   from tag in post.Tags
					   select new
					   \{
						   Tag = tag,
						   Count = 1
					   \},

		// The Reduce function: group all the BlogTagPostsCount objects we got back
		// from the Map function, use the Tag name as the key, and sum up all the
		// counts. Since the Map function gives each tag a Count of 1, when the Reduce
		// function returns we are going to have the correct Count of posts filed under
		// each tag.
		Reduce = results => from result in results
							group result by result.Tag
								into g
								select new
								\{
									Tag = g.Key,
									Count = g.Sum(x => x.Count)
								\}
	\});
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

Where `BlogTagPostsCount` is declared like this:

<TabItem value="blogpost_mapreduce_classes" label="blogpost_mapreduce_classes">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`public class BlogTagPostsCount
\{
	public string Tag \{ get; set; \}
	public int Count \{ get; set; \}
\}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

A better way of doing this is by creating an index class, and using `IndexCreation.CreateIndexes` to submit it to the server:

<TabItem value="static_indexes4" label="static_indexes4">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`public class BlogPosts_PostsCountByTag : AbstractIndexCreationTask<BlogPost, BlogPosts_PostsCountByTag.ReduceResult>
\{
	public class ReduceResult
	\{
		public string Tag \{ get; set; \}
		public int Count \{ get; set; \}
	\}

	// The index name generated by this is going to be BlogPosts/PostsCountByTag
	public BlogPosts_PostsCountByTag()
	\{
		Map = posts => from post in posts
					   from tag in post.Tags
					   select new
								  \{
									  Tag = tag,
									  Count = 1
								  \};

		Reduce = results => from result in results
							group result by result.Tag
								into g
								select new
										   \{
											   Tag = g.Key,
											   Count = g.Sum(x => x.Count)
										   \};
	\}
\}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

Either way, querying the indexes is the same. You can either let RavenDB decide which index to use, or instruct it to use a specific index by explicitly specifying the index name while querying. Here's how we would go about finding the count of posts tagged under the "RavenDB" tag:

<TabItem value="static_indexes6" label="static_indexes6">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`// This is how to query the first index we defined, using the BlogTagPostsCount class

var blogTagPostsCount = session.Query<BlogTagPostsCount>("BlogPosts/PostsCountByTag")
	.FirstOrDefault(x => x.Tag == "RavenDB")
	?? new BlogTagPostsCount();
count = blogTagPostsCount.Count;

// Alternatively, if we used an AbstractIndexCreationTask, we could use this version
// Note how we reuse the ReduceResult class to get back the information

var tagPostsCount = session.Query<BlogPosts_PostsCountByTag.ReduceResult, BlogPosts_PostsCountByTag>()
	.FirstOrDefault(x => x.Tag == "RavenDB")
	?? new BlogPosts_PostsCountByTag.ReduceResult();
count = tagPostsCount.Count;
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

### Using `AsDocument` and `MetadataFor`

To support more complex scenarios where one wants to use document metadata or document itself in index, the `AsDocument` and `MetadataFor` methos have been introduced.

First method can be used to create an index that contains **everything** from the given document and allows one to search over all of the values of all the properties of the provided entity.

<TabItem value="defining_static_index_1" label="defining_static_index_1">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`public class Users_AllProperties : AbstractIndexCreationTask<User, Users_AllProperties.Result>
\{
	public class Result
	\{
		public string Query \{ get; set; \}
	\}

	public Users_AllProperties()
	\{
		Map = users => from user in users
					   select new
						   \{
							   Query = AsDocument(user).Select(x => x.Value)
						   \};

		Index(x => x.Query, FieldIndexing.Analyzed);
	\}
\}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="defining_static_index_2" label="defining_static_index_2">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`session.Query<Users_AllProperties.Result, Users_AllProperties>()
	   .Where(x => x.Query == "Ayende") // search first name
	   .OfType<User>()
	   .ToList();

session.Query<Users_AllProperties.Result, Users_AllProperties>()
	   .Where(x => x.Query == "Rahien") // search last name
	   .OfType<User>()
	   .ToList();
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

<Admonition type="note" title="">
Indexing all entity properties will result in larger index sizes, decreased performance and may lead to poor search relevancy, because whole document is used as an index entry. Use with caution.
</Admonition>

Second method allows us to use document metadata inside the index. For example:   

<TabItem value="defining_static_index_3" label="defining_static_index_3">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`public class Users_LastModified : AbstractIndexCreationTask<User>
\{
	public class Result
	\{
		public DateTime LastModified \{ get; set; \}
	\}

	public Users_LastModified()
	\{
		Map = users => from user in users
					   select new
						   \{
							   LastModified = MetadataFor(user).Value<DateTime>("Last-Modified")
						   \};

		TransformResults = (database, results) => from result in results
												  select new
													  \{
														  FirstName = result.FirstName,
														  LastName = result.LastName,
														  LastModified = MetadataFor(result).Value<DateTime>("Last-Modified")
													  \};
	\}
\}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="defining_static_index_4" label="defining_static_index_4">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`session.Query<Users_LastModified.Result, Users_LastModified>()
       .OrderByDescending(x => x.LastModified)
       .OfType<User>()
       .ToList();
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
