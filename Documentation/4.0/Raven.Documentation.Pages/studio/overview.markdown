## Studio Overview
---

RavenDB comes with a Management Studio that can be accessed by any modern browser using the server url     
(e.g. http://localhost:8080/ - when your server runs at port 8080). 

The Studio lets you manage your server, databases, indexes, issue queries, perform various maintenance actions and much more,    
all in a very easy manner.

The Studio can be accessed on any RavenDB server, regardless of how it is deployed.
