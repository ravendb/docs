# Time Series Settings

---

{NOTE: }

* The **Time Series Settings view** allows you to define and manage time series 
  configurations per collection. Configurations may include:  

    * [Named Values](../../../document-extensions/timeseries/client-api/named-time-series-values)  
      A customized name can be set per time series value.  
      API methods can access time series values by their names.  
    
    * [Rollup Policies](../../../document-extensions/timeseries/rollup-and-retention#what-are-rollups)  
      Rollup policies define the time frame by which data from an origin time series 
      will be aggregated into a new **rollup time series**. 
      They summarize the current data and zoom out 
      to a bigger picture with a lower resolution that uses less storage space.
      You can set different levels of resolution by adding new rollup policies that further aggregate 
      the previously aggregated data.

    * [Retention Periods](../../../document-extensions/timeseries/rollup-and-retention)  
      A retention period defines how long time series entries are kept.  
      An entry that exceeds this period will be removed.  
      You can set a different retention period for each rollup so that you can delete the previous data after it has been summarized/aggregated.

{PANEL: Rationale for Configuring Time Series Policies}

Many applications continuously store massive amounts of time series data.  

Rollup policies help you manage the amount of data in storage by 
setting how close you want to zoom in and out in different time frames.  

Retention time periods then allow you to decide for how long to keep the higher resolution data in storage before it is deleted, 
or if to delete it at all.  
It must be kept at least until it is aggregated/summarized in the rollup policy, 
but can be set to be available for a period after the rollup, as seen in the example below.  

{NOTE: }
#### Heart Clinic Example  
Imagine a heart clinic whose raw data shows their patients' heart rates every minute.  
Here are the different levels of resolution that they want to see:  

!["Heart Clinic Example"](images/time-series-settings-10_HeartDoctorExample.png "Heart Clinic Example")

 * Raw Data  
   Tracks heart rate every minute.  
   Set to delete after 20 minutes when the data has already aggregated.  

 * DailySummary  
   They may want to know a person's average heart rate 
   every 15 minutes in a day to see a summary graph of daily activity levels. 
   They want to keep these daily activity summaries for a week.  

 * Month  
   Zooming out, they need to know the average heart rate every 3 hours, 
   and they want to keep the 3-hour summaries info for a month.  
   They can still zoom back in to see the daily summaries because each day is retained for a week. 

 * Long-term  
   After this, they only need to know their daily averages to see long-term trends.  
   They can always zoom into the latest Week, Day, and 20 Minute graphs.

{PANEL: Time Series Settings View}

!["Time Series Settings View"](images/time-series-settings-01_view.png "Time Series Settings View")

1. **Time Series Settings View**  
   Select **Settings** > **Time Series** to open the Time Series Settings View.  
2. **Enable/Disable Rollup & Retention Policies**  
    * Use the **checkbox** to select or deselect all the Rollup and Retention 
      policies defined in your configurations.  
    * Use the **Set status** dropdown list to enable or disable the selected  policies.  
      !["Set Status"](images/time-series-settings-02_enable-disable.png "Set Status")  
       * Disabled policies will **not be executed**.  
       * Enabled policies' **execution frequency** is determined -  
         By the server Policy Check Frequency (see below),  
         **-and-**  
         By the Rollup Time Frame and Retention Period set by each policy.  
         {NOTE: When a policy is executed:}
         
         * Aggregated entries will be created according to the policy's rollup time frame.  
         * Entries will be removed according to the policy's retention period.  
         {NOTE/}
3. **Policy Check Frequency**  
   Set the frequency by which the server checks and executes the Rollup and Retention policies.  
   {NOTE: }
   Note that any policy defined with a time frame shorter than the server's 
   **Policy Check Frequency** will still be executed at the server checkup time.  
   E.g., If Policy Check Frequency is set to 8 seconds, a retention policy set to 
   2 seconds will still be checked and executed every 8 seconds.  
   {NOTE/}

    * **(a) Raw Data**

       * **Rollup Policy Name**  
         In this example, the policy name is: `ByMinute`.

         into a new rollup time series named: `<raw-timeseries-name>@ByMinute`  
       * **Aggregation**  
         The aggregation period defined by the rollup policy.  
         In this example, every 1 minute of raw data will be aggregated into 
         a single entry of the `ByMinute` rollup time series.
         {NOTE: }
         An entry is added to the rollup time series only when the 
         defined aggregation time frame has ended.  
         {NOTE/}
       * **Retention**  
         The retention period defined for the rollup time series entries.

       * **Aggregation**  
         The aggregation period defined by the rollup policy.  
         In this example, every 30 minutes of data from the `ByMinute` 
         rollup time series will be aggregated into a single entry of the 
         `30Mins` rollup time series.  
         {NOTE: }
         An entry is added to the rollup time series only when the defined 
         aggregation time frame has ended.  
         {NOTE/}
       * **Retention**  
         The retention period defined for the rollup time series entries.

{PANEL: Rollup Policies for Rollup Time Series}

* Rollup policies can be created both for **Raw time series data**, 
  and for **data aggregated by other rollup time series**.  
* In a time series configuration, a rollup policy's source data 
  is determined by the policy's position.  
   * The **first** rollup policy aggregates **raw data** from 
     the time series of the selected collection.  
   * The **second** rollup policy aggregates data **from 
     the first rollup time series**.  
   * And so on: each additional rollup policy aggregates data from the 
     time series that precedes it.

{NOTE: }

* The Aggregation Time set by each policy must be **greater** than the 
  aggregation time set for the previous policy.  
* The Aggregation Time **cannot exceed** the Retention Period defined for the 
  previous time series.
{NOTE/}

!["Rollup Policies for Rollup Time Series"](images/time-series-settings-09_rollup-time-series.png "Rollup Policies for Rollup Time Series")  


1. **Time Series Raw Data**  
   The raw data collected in time series of the selected collection.  

2. **Rollup Time Series for Raw Data**  
   The `ByMinute` rollup policy aggregates raw data from time series 
   in the `Companies` collection.  
   Every minute of raw time series data is aggregated into 
   a single entry of the new rollup time series.  

3. **Rollup Time Series for Rollup Time Series**  
   The `30Mins` rollup policy aggregates data from the rollup time series 
   that was created by the `ByMinute` policy.  
   Every 30 minutes of data from the `ByMinute` rollup time series 
   are aggregated into a single entry of the new `30Mins` rollup time series.
