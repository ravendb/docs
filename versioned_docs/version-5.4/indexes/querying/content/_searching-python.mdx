* Prior to reading this article, please refer to [full-Text search with dynamic queries](../../../client-api/session/querying/text-search/full-text-search.mdx) 
  to learn about the `search` method.  

* **All capabilities** provided by `search` with a dynamic query can also be used when querying a static-index.

* However, as opposed to making a dynamic search query where an auto-index is created for you,  
  when using a **static-index**:  

    * You must configure the index-field in which you want to search.  
      See examples below.  
      
    * You can configure which analyzer will be used to tokenize this field.  
      See [selecting an analyzer](../../../indexes/using-analyzers.mdx#selecting-an-analyzer-for-a-field).    
* In this page:
  * [Indexing single field for FTS](../../../indexes/querying/searching.mdx#indexing-single-field-for-fts)
  * [Indexing multiple fields for FTS](../../../indexes/querying/searching.mdx#indexing-multiple-fields-for-fts)
  * [Boosting search results](../../../indexes/querying/searching.mdx#boosting-search-results)

## Indexing single field for FTS

#### The index:

<TabItem value="index_1" label="index_1">
<CodeBlock language="python">
{`class Employees_ByNotes(AbstractIndexCreationTask):
    # The IndexEntry class defines the index-fields
    class IndexEntry:
        def __init__(self, employee_notes: str = None):
            self.employee_notes = employee_notes

    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        # The 'Map' function defines the content of the index-fields
        self.map = "from employee in docs.Employees " "select new " "\{ " " employee_notes = employee.Notes[0]" "\}"

        # Configure the index-field for FTS:
        # Set 'FieldIndexing.Search' on index-field 'employee_notes'
        self._index("employee_notes", FieldIndexing.SEARCH)

        # Optionally: Set your choice of analyzer for the index-field:
        # Here the text from index-field 'EmployeeNotes' will be tokenized by 'WhitespaceAnalyzer'.
        self._analyze("employee_notes", "WhitespaceAnalyzer")

        # Note:
        # If no analyzer is set then the default 'RavenStandardAnalyzer' is used.
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
#### Query with Search:

* Use `Search` to make a full-text search when querying the index.  

* Refer to [Full-Text search with dynamic queries](../../../client-api/session/querying/text-search/full-text-search.mdx) for all available **Search options**,  
  such as using wildcards, searching for multiple terms, etc.

<Tabs groupId='languageSyntax'>
<TabItem value="Query" label="Query">
<CodeBlock language="python">
{`employees = list(
    session
    # Query the index
    .query_index_type(Employees_ByNotes, Employees_ByNotes.IndexEntry)
    # Call 'search':
    # pass the index field that was configured for FTS and the term to search for.
    .search("employee_notes", "French").of_type(Employee)
)
# * Results will contain all Employee documents that have 'French' in their 'Notes' field.

# * Search is case-sensitive since field was indexed using the 'WhitespaceAnalyzer'
#   which preserves casing.

## Indexing multiple fields for FTS

#### The index:

<TabItem value="index_2" label="index_2">
<CodeBlock language="python">
{`class Employees_ByEmployeeData(AbstractIndexCreationTask):
    class IndexEntry:
        def __init__(self, employee_data: List = None):
            self.employee_data = employee_data

    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.map = (
            "from employee in docs.Employees "
            "select new \{"
            "  employee_data = "
            "  \{"
            # Multiple document-fields can be indexed
            # into the single index-field 'employee_data'
            "    employee.FirstName,"
            "    employee.LastName,"
            "    employee.Title,"
            "    employee.Notes"
            "  \}"
            "\}"
        )
        # Configure the index-field for FTS:
        # Set 'FieldIndexing.SEARCH' on index-field 'employee_data'
        self._index("employee_data", FieldIndexing.SEARCH)

        # Note:
        # Since no analyzer is set, the default 'RavenStandardAnalyzer' is used.
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
#### Sample query:

<Tabs groupId='languageSyntax'>
<TabItem value="Query" label="Query">
<CodeBlock language="python">
{`employees = list(
    session
    # Query the static-index
    .query_index_type(Employees_ByEmployeeData, Employees_ByEmployeeData.IndexEntry)
    .open_subclause()
    # A logical OR is applied between the following two search calls
    .search("employee_data", "Manager")
    # A logical AND is applied between the following two terms
    .search("employee_data", "French Spanish", operator=SearchOperator.AND)
    .close_subclause()
    .of_type(Employee)
)

# * Results will contain all Employee documents that have:
#   ('Manager' in any of the 4 document-fields that were indexed)
#   OR
#   ('French' AND 'Spanish' in any of the 4 document-fields that were indexed)

# * Search is case-insensitive since the default analyzer is used
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="RQL" label="RQL">
<CodeBlock language="sql">
{`from index "Employees/ByEmployeeData"
where (search(EmployeeData, "Manager") or search(EmployeeData, "French Spanish", and))
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>



## Boosting search results

* In order to prioritize results, you can provide a boost value to the searched terms.  
  This can be applied by either of the following:

  * Add a boost value to the relevant index-field **inside the index definition**.  
    Refer to article [indexes - boosting](../../../indexes/boosting.mdx).

  * Add a boost value to the queried terms **at query time**.  
    Refer to article [Boost search results](../../../client-api/session/querying/text-search/boost-search-results.mdx).
