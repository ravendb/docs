## The Billing & Costs Tab

The Billing & Costs tab will show your existing resources and their costs as well as past billing events.

### Pay Now

 The *Pay Now* button is designed to facilitate immediate payment of outstanding costs accrued from previous billing
 cycles. This feature is especially useful for ensuring timely payments and maintaining up-to-date account status.
 It can be used when automatic charge fails due to reasons like expired cards or insufficient funds.
 You can read more about the _Pay Now_ option on the [Pricing, Payment and Billing](../cloud-pricing-payment-billing.mdx#pay-now) page.

### Current billing period
