# Glossary: Raft Consensus Algorithm

### What is Raft?

Raft is a [distributed consensus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_(computer_science)) algorithm designed to be understandable and durable. 

In general, the algorithm is useful when we want to order the events that happen in a distributed system on different nodes.

In RavenDB, Raft is used to coordinate the execution of cluster-wide operations over the nodes. 

If we want to create a database in a cluster, creating the database on all cluster nodes, the Raft will be used to make sure that the database creation is executed in at least (n/2) + 1 nodes. (quorum of nodes)
