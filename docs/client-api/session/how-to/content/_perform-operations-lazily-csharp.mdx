* **Lazy request**:

    * You can define a lazy request within a session (e.g. a lazy-query or a lazy-load request)  
      and defer its execution until actually needed.

    * The lazy request definition is stored in the session and a `Lazy<T>` instance is returned.  
      The request will be sent to the server and executed only when you access the value of this instance.

* **Multiple lazy requests**:

    * Multiple lazy requests can be defined within the same session.

    * When triggering the deferred execution (whether implicitly or explicitly),  
      ALL pending lazy requests held up by the session will be sent to the server in a single call.  
      This can help reduce the number of remote calls made to the server over the network.

## Operations that can be executed lazily

### Load entities

[Load](../../../client-api/session/loading-entities.mdx#load) loads a document entity from 
the database into the session.  
Loading entities can be executed **lazily**.   

<TabItem value="lazy_Load" label="lazy_Load">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`Lazy<Employee> lazyEmployee = session
     // Add a call to Lazily 
    .Advanced.Lazily
     // Document will Not be loaded from the database here, no server call is made
    .Load<Employee>("employees/1-A");

Employee employee = lazyEmployee.Value; // 'Load' operation is executed here
// The employee entity is now loaded & tracked by the session
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
### Load entities with include

[Load with include](../../../client-api/session/loading-entities.mdx#load-with-includes) loads both the document and the specified related document.    
Loading entities with include can be executed **lazily**.

<Tabs groupId='languageSyntax'>
<TabItem value="Lazy_load_with_include" label="Lazy_load_with_include">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`Lazy<Product> lazyProduct = session
     // Add a call to Lazily 
    .Advanced.Lazily
     // Request to include the related Supplier document
     // Documents will Not be loaded from the database here, no server call is made
    .Include<Product>(x => x.SupplierId) 
    .Load<Product>("products/1-A"); 

// 'Load with include' operation will be executed here
// Both documents will be retrieved from the database
Product product = lazyProduct.Value;
// The product entity is now loaded & tracked by the session

// Access the related document, no additional server call is made
Supplier supplier = session.Load<Supplier>(product.SupplierId);
// The supplier entity is now also loaded & tracked by the session
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="The_document" label="The_document">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`public class Product
{
    public string Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public string SupplierId { get; set; } // The related document ID
}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
### Load entities starting with

[LoadStartingWith](../../../client-api/session/loading-entities.mdx#loadstartingwith) loads entities whose ID starts with the specified prefix.  
Loading entities with a common prefix can be executed **lazily**.

<TabItem value="lazy_LoadStartingWith" label="lazy_LoadStartingWith">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`Lazy<Dictionary<string, Employee>> lazyEmployees = session
     // Add a call to Lazily 
    .Advanced.Lazily
     // Request to load entities whose ID starts with 'employees/'
     // Documents will Not be loaded from the database here, no server call is made
    .LoadStartingWith<Employee>("employees/");

var employees = lazyEmployees.Value; // 'Load' operation is executed here
// The employee entities are now loaded & tracked by the session
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
### Conditional load

[ConditionalLoad](../../../client-api/session/loading-entities.mdx#conditionalload) logic is: 

* If the entity is already loaded to the session:  
  no server call is made, the tracked entity is returned.  
* If the entity is Not already loaded to the session:  
  the document will be loaded from the server only if the change-vector provided to the 
  method is older than the one in the server (i.e. if the document in the server is newer).  
* Loading entities conditionally can be executed **lazily**.  

<TabItem value="lazy_ConditionalLoad" label="lazy_ConditionalLoad">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`// Create document and get its change-vector:
string changeVector; 
using (var session1 = store.OpenSession())
\{
    Employee employee = new Employee();
    session1.Store(employee, "employees/1-A");
    session1.SaveChanges();
    
    // Get the tracked entity change-vector
    changeVector = session1.Advanced.GetChangeVectorFor(employee);
\}

// Conditionally lazy-load the document:
using (var session2 = store.OpenSession())
\{
    var lazyEmployee = session2
         // Add a call to Lazily 
        .Advanced.Lazily
         // Document will Not be loaded from the database here, no server call is made
        .ConditionalLoad<Employee>("employees/1-A", changeVector);

    var loadedItem = lazyEmployee.Value; // 'ConditionalLoad' operation is executed here
    Employee employee = loadedItem.Entity;
    
    // If ConditionalLoad has actually fetched the document from the server (logic described above)
    // then the employee entity is now loaded & tracked by the session
    
\}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
### Run query

A Query can be executed **lazily**.  
Learn more about running queries lazily in [lazy queries](../../../client-api/session/querying/how-to-perform-queries-lazily.mdx).

<TabItem value="lazy_Query" label="lazy_Query">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`// Define a lazy query:
Lazy<IEnumerable<Employee>> lazyEmployees = session
    .Query<Employee>()
    .Where( x => x.FirstName == "John")
     // Add a call to Lazily, the query will Not be executed here 
    .Lazily();

IEnumerable<Employee> employees = lazyEmployees.Value; // Query is executed here

// Note: Since query results are not projected,
// then the resulting employee entities will be tracked by the session.
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
### Get revisions

All methods for [getting revisions](../../../document-extensions/revisions/client-api/session/loading.mdx) and their metadata can be executed **lazily**.

<TabItem value="lazy_Revisions" label="lazy_Revisions">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`Lazy<List<Employee>> lazyRevisions = session
     // Add a call to Lazily 
    .Advanced.Revisions.Lazily
     // Revisions will Not be fetched here, no server call is made
    .GetFor<Employee>("employees/1-A");

     // Usage is the same for the other get revisions methods:
     // .Get()
     // .GetMetadataFor()

List<Employee> revisions = lazyRevisions.Value; // Getting revisions is executed here
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
### Get compare-exchange value

[Getting compare-exchange](../../../compare-exchange/get-cmpxchg-item.mdx#get-compare-exchange-item-lazily) 
values can be executed **lazily**.

<TabItem value="lazy_CompareExchange" label="lazy_CompareExchange">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`using (var session =
       store.OpenSession(new SessionOptions \{ TransactionMode = TransactionMode.ClusterWide \}))
\{
    // Create compare-exchange value:
    session.Advanced.ClusterTransaction
        .CreateCompareExchangeValue(key: "someKey", value: "someValue");
    session.SaveChanges();

    // Get the compare-exchange value lazily: 
    Lazy<CompareExchangeValue<string>> lazyCmpXchg = session
        // Add a call to Lazily 
        .Advanced.ClusterTransaction.Lazily
        // Compare-exchange values will Not be fetched here, no server call is made
        .GetCompareExchangeValue<string>("someKey");
    
    // Usage is the same for the other method:
    // .GetCompareExchangeValues()

    CompareExchangeValue<string> cmpXchgValue =
        lazyCmpXchg.Value; // Getting compare-exchange value is executed here
\}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>



## Multiple lazy requests 

### Execute all requests - implicitly

Accessing the value of ANY of the lazy instances will trigger
the execution of ALL pending lazy requests held up by the session, 
in a SINGLE server call.  

<TabItem value="lazy_ExecuteAll_Implicit" label="lazy_ExecuteAll_Implicit">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`// Define multiple lazy requests
Lazy<User> lazyUser1 = session.Advanced.Lazily.Load<User>("users/1-A");
Lazy<User> lazyUser2 = session.Advanced.Lazily.Load<User>("users/2-A");

Lazy<IEnumerable<Employee>> lazyEmployees = session.Query<Employee>()
    .Lazily();
Lazy<IEnumerable<Product>> lazyProducts = session.Query<Product>()
    .Search(x => x.Name, "Ch*")
    .Lazily();

// Accessing the value of ANY of the lazy instances will trigger
// the execution of ALL pending lazy requests held up by the session
// This is done in a SINGLE server call
User user1 = lazyUser1.Value;

// ALL the other values are now also available
// No additional server calls are made when accessing these values
User user2 = lazyUser2.Value;
IEnumerable<Employee> employees = lazyEmployees.Value;
IEnumerable<Product> products = lazyProducts.Value;
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
### Execute all requests - explicitly

Explicitly calling `ExecuteAllPendingLazyOperations` will execute 
ALL pending lazy requests held up by the session, in a SINGLE server call.  

<TabItem value="lazy_ExecuteAll_Explicit" label="lazy_ExecuteAll_Explicit">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`// Define multiple lazy requests
Lazy<User> lazyUser1 = session.Advanced.Lazily.Load<User>("users/1-A");
Lazy<User> lazyUser2 = session.Advanced.Lazily.Load<User>("users/2-A");

Lazy<IEnumerable<Employee>> lazyEmployees = session.Query<Employee>()
    .Lazily();
Lazy<IEnumerable<Product>> lazyProducts = session.Query<Product>()
    .Search(x => x.Name, "Ch*")
    .Lazily();

// Explicitly call 'ExecuteAllPendingLazyOperations'
// ALL pending lazy requests held up by the session will be executed in a SINGLE server call
session.Advanced.Eagerly.ExecuteAllPendingLazyOperations();

// ALL values are now available
// No additional server calls are made when accessing the values
User user1 = lazyUser1.Value;
User user2 = lazyUser2.Value;
IEnumerable<Employee> employees = lazyEmployees.Value;
IEnumerable<Product> products = lazyProducts.Value;
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
