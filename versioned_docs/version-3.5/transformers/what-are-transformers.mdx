# What are transformers?

The easiest explanation of Transformers is that they are  **LINQ-based server-side projection functions** with the ability to load external documents, including additional results, and even to make decisions based on passed parameters, and much more.

<Admonition type="info" title="Transformers and the session" id="transformers-and-the-session" href="#transformers-and-the-session">
Because you are working with projections, and not directly with documents, 
they are _not_ tracked by the session and won't be saved in the database if you call `SaveChanges`.
</Admonition>

## Basic example

If we want to transform our query or load results, we need to perform the following steps:

- first we need to create a transformer. One way to create it is to use `AbstractTransformerCreationTask`, but there are other ways that you can read about [here](../transformers/creating-and-deploying.mdx).

<TabItem value="transformers_1" label="transformers_1">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`public class Employees_NameAndPhone : AbstractTransformerCreationTask<Employee>
\{
	public class Result
	\{
		public string FirstName \{ get; set; \}

		public double LastName \{ get; set; \}

		public double HomePhone \{ get; set; \}
	\}

	public Employees_NameAndPhone()
	\{
		TransformResults = employees => from employee in employees 
						select new
						\{
							employee.FirstName, 
							employee.LastName, 
							employee.HomePhone
						\};
	\}
\}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

- since transformers work server-side, next logical step would be to send it to the server. More information about how to deploy transformers can be found [here](../transformers/creating-and-deploying.mdx).

<TabItem value="transformers_2" label="transformers_2">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`// save transformer on server
new Employees_NameAndPhone().Execute(store);
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

- now, while querying or even loading, we can project our results using appropriate transformer.

<TabItem value="transformers_3" label="transformers_3">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`Employees_NameAndPhone.Result result = session
	.Load<Employees_NameAndPhone, Employees_NameAndPhone.Result>("employees/1");
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="transformers_4" label="transformers_4">
<CodeBlock language="csharp">
{`IList<Employees_NameAndPhone.Result> results = session
	.Query<Employee>()
	.TransformWith<Employees_NameAndPhone, Employees_NameAndPhone.Result>()
	.ToList();
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
