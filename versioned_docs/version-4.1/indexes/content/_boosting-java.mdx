A feature that RavenDB leverages from Lucene is called Boosting. This feature gives you the ability to manually tune the relevance level of matching documents when performing a query. 

From the index perspective we can associate to an index entry a boosting factor. The higher value it has, the more relevant term will be. To do this, we must use the `Boost` method.

Let's jump straight into the example. To perform the query that will return employees where either `FirstName` or `LastName` is equal to _Bob_, and to promote employees (move them to the top of the results) where `FirstName` matches the phrase, we must first create an index with boosted entry.

<Tabs groupId='languageSyntax'>
<TabItem value="AbstractIndexCreationTask" label="AbstractIndexCreationTask">
<CodeBlock language="java">
{`public class Employees_ByFirstAndLastName extends AbstractIndexCreationTask {
    public Employees_ByFirstAndLastName() {
        map = "docs.Employees.Select(employee => new {" +
            "    FirstName = employee.FirstName.Boost(10)," +
            "    LastName = employee.LastName" +
            "})";
    }
}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Operation" label="Operation">
<CodeBlock language="java">
{`IndexDefinition indexDefinition = new IndexDefinition();
indexDefinition.setName("Employees/ByFirstAndLastName");
indexDefinition.setMaps(Collections.singleton(
    "docs.Employees.Select(employee => new {" +
    "    FirstName = employee.FirstName.Boost(10)," +
    "    LastName = employee.LastName" +
    "})"));

store.maintenance().send(new PutIndexesOperation(indexDefinition));
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The next step is to perform a query against that index:

<TabItem value="boosting_3" label="boosting_3">
<CodeBlock language="java">
{`// employees with 'firstName' equal to 'Bob'
// will be higher in results
// than the ones with 'lastName' match
List<Employee> results = session.query(Employee.class, Employees_ByFirstAndLastName.class)
    .whereEquals("FirstName", "Bob")
    .whereEquals("LastName", "Bob")
    .toList();
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>

## Remarks

Boosting is also available at the query level. You can read more about it [here](../../indexes/querying/boosting.mdx).
