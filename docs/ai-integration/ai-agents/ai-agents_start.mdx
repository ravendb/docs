# AI Agents: Start
<Admonition type="note" title="">

AI agents are server-side components that act as secure proxies between RavenDB clients and AI models. They can be easily customized to handle specific client needs, tasks or workflows, such as answering questions, performing data analysis, or automating processes.  
 - Using AI agents frees developers from the need to manage the communication with the AI model in their code, and enables rapid integration of AI capabilities into their applications.  
 - An agent receives requests from clients and maintains continuous conversations with AI models to fulfill them. During the conversation, the agent can enable the model to securely query a RavenDB database and request the client to perform actions.  
- [See common AI agents use cases](../../ai-integration/ai-agents/ai-agents_start#use-cases)
