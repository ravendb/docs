## Revisions and Attachments

If [document revisions](../../document-extensions/revisions/overview/) are enabled, any addition or removal of attachments will create a new revision of the document.
This is because the attachment metadata is part of the document and is updated when attachments change.

Any modification to the metadata of a document creates a revision when revisions are enabled.

## Remote Attachments (Optional Feature)

When Remote Attachments are enabled, RavenDB can upload attachments to external storage services such as:
Amazon S3
Azure Blob Storage

Instead of storing the binary stream directly in the database, the server stores a reference to the external location and uploads the content asynchronously in the background.

How it works:

Attachments are marked for remote upload at the time they are added
You configure remote destinations in the database settings
Uploads are handled by a background task, without blocking client operations

Remote Attachments are useful when:
You need to store large binary content but reduce database size
You want to take advantage of external storage redundancy and scaling
