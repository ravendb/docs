# Modify GenAI Task: Studio

Saved tasks are listed in the AI Tasks view.  
Selecting a task from the list will take you to the task's [Review task configuration](../../../ai-integration/gen-ai-integration/create-gen-ai-task/create-gen-ai-task_studio#review-configuration-and-save-task) page, which provides an overall view of the task configuration and allows you to review different sections, edit them, and save the modified configuration when you're done.
